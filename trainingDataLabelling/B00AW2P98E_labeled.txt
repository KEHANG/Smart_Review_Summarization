size***The Nikon Coolpix S6400 is very small, measuring 3.8 x 2.4 x 1.1 inches and weighs about 5 ounces.
zoom***The 12X lens extends from a 35 mm equivalent focal length of 25 mm to 300 mm.
pictures***The 1/2.3 inch image sensor is typical of digital cameras of this class.
other features***Because the sensor's low light performance is proportional to its size (generally, the large the sensor, the better its low light sensitivity), this class of camera performs best where there is ample light.
zoom***On the other hand, also because of the small sensor size, it becomes possible to design a zoom lens with greater zoom range without prohibitive physical dimensions/weight or cost.
size***It is amazing that Nikon can squeeze a 12X lens into a case that is just 1.1 inches thick.
screen***The Coolpix S6400 features a touch-sensitive screen that does away with many traditional buttons; only the shutter, movie, play mode, and camera mode buttons are actual physical buttons.
screen***A 3-inch screen can be fitted here mainly because of the minimization of real buttons.
size***This also leaves very little space to place your thumb when holding the camera; luckily the camera is very light  so it doesn't strain my fingers when taking pictures.
no feature***I always tie a hand strap between the camera and its case (not included), so that I can hold the case with my left hand while I take picture with my right hand.
no feature***This is a safety arrangement to make sure that I am less likely to drop my camera to the ground when someone inadvertently bumps into me.
battery***Original manufacturer's battery is often very expensive (>$20), so I usually buy new third party battery on eBay.
battery***For the Coolpix S6400, you can typically get two EN-EL19 compatible batteries with free shipping for less than $10.
no feature***The EH-69P AC Adapter/Charger included in the camera package is in fact a AC to USB converter, not a standalone battery charger.
battery***This means the battery needs to be charged inside the camera, like so many others.
no feature***This problem can be solved with just a little cost.
no feature***While Nikon's MH-66 battery charger costs $42.95 retail, you can buy a third party external charger for the S6400 on eBay for $3.99, with free shipping.
other features***There is another model (S6500) that is identical to the S6400 except that it has an additional Wi-Fi file transfer capability.
no feature***I bought the S6400 because I don't need this feature and the S6400 has a better bang-for-the-buck.
no feature***Update (1/7/2014):After a few weeks of use, I found two somewhat annoying things about the S6400, which prompted me to take off one star from my original 5-star rating of this camera.1.
other features***Upon pressing the on/off button to turn on the camera, I need to wait about 8 seconds before I can press the shutter release to take a picture, so if I see something happening fast and whip out the S6400 to attempt to take a picture, chances are I would miss it.
other features***Moreover, if the camera goes into energy-saving mode after the default 1-minute time (user changeable), it will also take 8 seconds to return the camera to operation capable status.2.
screen***Touch control may not be as accurate and reliable as physical button.
screen***I cannot browse pictures quickly, as the touch interface simply won't allow it, furthermore, navigating a picture after zooming in is slow and unreliable.
pictures***Knowing now that the S6400 is not well suited for quick shots, I still like the pictures that the S6400 can produce.
zoom***The auto focus lens is fast and sharp, and the colors are very nice.
pictures***Pictures taken with flash always look evenly lit and well-exposed.
no feature***Nikon 6400.
no feature***Bought this to replace a old Nikon 3700. what a difference, the old one did a job over the years, thousands of pic and movies lot of wild life ..
no feature***This new 6400 is like a Cadilac compared to the 3700 being a horse and buggy, there is no comparison.
no feature***the old said 3x Zoom.
zoom***it would not zoom at 25 feet, looked the same as no zoom, I was leary of this one which is 12Xzoom, Oh the old one while in movie would not Zoom, the New one zooms in any mode and It is truly a 12 zoom, will try to attach 2 photos taken at 300 or more feet no zoom and 12 zoom, it does what it says.
screen***clear touch screen, that is a time saver, only had it a few hours and all ready learned a lot, touch screen makes it easy to navigate and change the settings, the old one never did learn how to use all the features and was terribly slow navigation.
no feature***Smaller slimmer can't say how much I like this 6400, at $129.00 it is a steal.
battery***By the way some one said charging is crappy, I ordered this from amazon and now have 3 batteries , one with it and the two with a charger, always have one charged, think I paid around $17.00 charger and two batteries at Amazonhere's the link B008UZHDOI5 day's laterBoy practiced on some squirrels at 80 feet, one was setting and one was in full run, both came out perfect, the running shot no blur, both filled the pic like they were 5 feet away,update two months of use, still love it more, But the batteries that I have the link to at amazon, why, because the stock sony battery failed to charge with very little use, the others are great, last forever.
no feature***can't seem I can insert a product link so heres the link copy pasteB008UZHDOI
no feature***I received this camera as a gift (purchased at Costco in a bundle pack).
battery***It works wonderfully as a simple point and shoot camera and has great battery life.
battery***I've had it for a year and probably have to charge the battery once every 2 months or so.
other features***Also, I had an issue with the lens retracting after my son dropped it about 10 mo into ownership and Nikon fixed my camera good as new for the cost of shipping it to them.

video***The video quality is good though keeping moving subjects in focus is not easy.

battery***Since the battery can only be charged through the camera, I purchased a third party charger and battery on eBay.
no feature***The information and specifications shown on Amazon for this camera are lacking.
battery***I assumed the camera would come with an external charger for the camera battery (standard with many other Nikon cameras but not mentioned in the description)  however that was not the case.
battery***The camera does come with a charger however you have to charge the battery while it is in the camera and the charging cord plugs directly into the camera.
battery***It's not always safe, convenient, or secure to leave the camera laying out while charging.
pictures***The camera is very slow taking multiple back to back pictures, with about a 5 second delay between shots, regardless of setting.
other features***The on/off switch is very sensitive.
no feature***I find the camera occasionally trying to turn on while in the case as the result of the slightest vibration.

pictures***Not perfect but takes really good pictures most of the time.
no feature***When it doesn't it's usually operator error and not camera.

no feature***Otherwise great camera.
