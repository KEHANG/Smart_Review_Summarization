***I loved this camera so much I bought the upgrade (a6300) the minute I saw the announcement.
***Be aware that the learning curve is steep - this camera has massive amounts of features and compute power and to use it well is a big project.
***And there are a whole bunch of annoyances - I have to be very careful not to change the ISO setting in using the rear control wheel for shutter speed, for example.
***And yes the viewfinder shade falls off easily, and there are a bunch of other irritations.
***For me they are all overmatched by 1) the lightness of the camera and 2) its *awesome* power to take fantastic pictures.
***It really is.
***Especially in low light.
***Lastly the wi-fi implementation to upload to smartphone OR laptop works great and greatly facilitates posting to social media.
***Now that it's cheaper its and even better deal.
***I purchased the camera to take some amazing pictures in Iceland.
***I can't say that I'm avid photographer, but I've taken quite a lot of amazing shots.
***I was really excited to take some killer shots with the camera, but wasn't impressed.
***I kept the camera in Auto majority of the time with the occasional chance to play with settings in manual mode.
***Most of my pictures, though they looked nice on the screen, were quite grainy when zoomed in on the computer.
***I have used cheaper cameras in the past that have taken better pictures.
***In fact, the pictures I was able to take using my Samsung Galaxy S6 edge came out the same or better.
***My friend used her iPhone with similar results.
***Perhaps I'm missing something here or didn't know about a setting that took grainy-mode off, but either way, out of the box, it didn't do what I needed, and that was to capture some great images.
***Did tons of research before I bought this gem.
***Was looking at Cannons and Nikon and the new Panasonic G7 that records in 4K but ultimately decided on this camera for its 179 focal points, fast auto focus and 11fps.
***If you are looking for a compact mirrorless shooter look no further than the a6000, take the kit lens off put a sigma on it and let this thing rip you some photos that rival the big DSLR's.
***(I'm giving this 3 stars because my order was really bad.
***The camera, I give 5 stars.)
***The camera really amazes me, seriously.
***I've been an avid DSLR user with photography and video for years now.
***I've been keeping track with the mirrorless camera hype, but never decided to get one.
***Now that I have, I understand completely.
***The first time I used it, it felt odd.
***Since I know what the manual controls on every camera do, it was fairly easy to adjust to the different layout style than Nikon or Canon.
***But after I used it 1 time, I had to use it again.
***I wanted to come back to it instead of my trusted Nikon DSLR.
***I don't care for the kit lens because it seems a bit soft and the motorized zoom really drains the battery.
***I purchased a Nikon F mount lens adapter and also a Pentax K mount adapter so I could use the lenses i'm used to.
***After that, man, quality is outstanding with RAW format photos, as well as video.
***Even though the video isn't 4K like your competing mirrorless camera, it's still great full HD.
***So overall, if you're wanting to make a decision, get the camera unless you just HAVE to have full frame.
***Just make sure you get an extra battery kit.
***What was wrong with my order?
***Well, I bought it new.
***What came the first time was definitely NOT new.
***I noticed it looked opened before and had dust all over it.
***So, I took a photo to see the metadata and it had approximately 1,800 shutter actuations.
***I was really bummed to have to do an order exchange, but it went better than I thought it would.
***Amazon overnight shipped me a new one and I returned the old.
***It was an easy return, but irritating experience.
***Love my little camera
***Awesome little camera!
***Read the reviews, there is a reason its rated top notch.
***Superb.
***I am far from to top notch photographer, but have always enjoyed taking photos.
***I decided to up my game a little and after much research went with the A6000 over the A6300 because I really didn't need 4K video, and have nothing I could use to watch it anyway!
***This camera is very easy to use and takes excellent photos.
***It has so many built in functions that I am still exploring to find them all.
***One of the things I really appreciate is the size.
***I bought an extra lens to use for my daughters' sports and musical performances, which adds to the size.
***However, with the kit lens on it, it is small enough to put into a small case (Mirrorless Mover 5, in my case) and take with you to someplace like an amusement park without any inconvenience whatsoever.
***I know this isn't something that a professional photographer would be concerned with, but someone who just wants a great camera handy for family photos, or the ability to take top level photos when the situation calls for it, will be very happy with this purchase.
***I am a long time Canon shooter and serious hobbyist (sometimes freelancer as well) and I have turned up my nose at these little mirrorless systems for a long time.
***How could this tiny little thing possibly hold a candle to my trusty 6D?
***I recently picked one of these up with a Sony 20mm 2.8 prime just to have a camera to stick in my jacket pocket at festivals and when I don't want to lug around the beast.
***Well, after an mere hour cruising around the block with this thing and taking crappy little potshots I have been won over.
***If you haven't shot with a good EVF before, you don't know what you're missing out on.
***Live histogram, exposure preview, live zebras for clipped areas, focus peeking, variable grid patterns, really, really good focus tracking (compared to my 6D) and tons of fps on top of it all (if that's your thing).
***The hype is real, people.
***That's all well and good, except hey, this is an APS-C camera, and while the EVF features are cool, when it really comes down to it I own a full frame for a reason: image quality.
***Got the raw shots into Lightroom and I was blown away at the quality.
***The 24mps of this sensor really do a great job at resolving detail, and the lens performed incredibly well.
***Keep in mind here i'm used to shooting the 6D with the Canon 24-70 2.8 mark ii attached, or some other piece of L glass.
***I don't mean to sound like some loaded snob here, just trying to put things in context.
***We can skip the rest of the praise.
***Long story short, my canon body and 24-70 are going on the open market to finance the switch over to Sony.
***That decision was made in the span of a weekend, and I have absolutely no qualms about it.
***I'm done waiting for Canon to come out with their mirrorless competitor.
***If the A7ii anything like this little guy, I predict that i'm going to be a very happy photographer in the coming months.
***Love the optics and most of the street photo results but the camera software and Sony web interface is a decade behind - its very slow and non-intuitive.
***Lots of capability but won't automatically backup to Amazon Cloud nor most other photo storage (like my Samsung phone and camera do).
***Wish they had copied Samsung interface and software.
***Very happy item looked new works perfect and takes great photos.
***Bought this during the thanksgiving bundle... and love it.
***This is my first interchangeable lens camera and I am happy I choose A6000.
***Compact and its lighter so easy to carry it around.
***I upgraded to this camera from an older model, so I was able to use my lenses I already had.
***I absolutely LOVE this camera!
***If you had a Sony Alpha before- this one will not disappoint.
***It has the option to transfer photos to your computer or an app on your phone using wireless connection- which has saved me when I ran out of space on my memory card during a vacation.
***It takes beautiful photos and videos.
***I also like the new button they added to quickly switch to video or to rotate through the different modes without having to play with the digital screen.
***Got this camera and returned it as it was different then the one in the picture.
***The one I got is a little larger then the one pictured as well it had a view finder.
***This is a model better then the one I had purchased however due to the $120 difference in cost I returned it for the a5100.
***These Sony cameras are the best and take the greatest pictures.
***I also own a Nikon D5300 with a ton of lenses, Nikon S9500, Canon Point and shoot, and none of them compare to the Sony a5100, in picture quality and ease of use.
***The a6000 is a higher quality camera then the model I currently own.
***I assume the pictures from it are most likely superior to the lower end model.
***The a6000 is a larger camera by a small margin then the a5000 and a5100 and it has a few additional features.
***Amazon Warehouse saved hundreds on this purchase.
***You cannot go wrong with a Sony Alpha or NEX.
***Incredible camera.
***Focus is extremely fast.
***Tremendous clarity.
***I know it will happen; but, I would like to see Sony come out with more E mount long telephotos.
***I also have a Nikon D7100 and resort to that camera for extreme telephoto.
***C'mon Sony, between the A6000 and the A6300, gotta have more long telephotos Not really interested in adapters to get what I want.
***Camera itself is great.

PERSONAL TESTIMONIAL
-----------------------------------------
I vowed I'd never return to cropped sensor (APS-C) cameras after purchasing a Canon 6D full frame camera.
***However, I did my research on the mirrorless platform, and I was sold on the Sony a6000, so much that I sold my Canon gear to fund the purchase of this camera body.
***The weight difference between the 6D body and the a6000 body is like night and day, and my neck will thank me later.
***Upon taking my first photos with the a6000, I instantly noticed the difference in color reproduction and dynamic range over my former camera.
***Then, I tried continuous shooting and I was floored--11 frames per second, which now allows me to take much better action shots.
***That, along with the a6000's extremely quick auto-focus resulted in some great photos of my daughter's very first soccer game.
***High ISO performance on the a6000 rivals that of a full frame camera.
***Now, it will be better on full frame, but the a6000 comes very close.
***With my Canon APS-C cameras (t3, t4i, and 60D), noise level was quite prominent above ISO 1600.
***With the a6000, photos at ISO 6400 are usable, and in some cases, even up to ISO 12,800.
***The built-in wi-fi has been helpful in allowing me to download apps directly to my camera.
***I've tested NFC on an Android phone, and it works perfectly (after downloading and installing the Sony PlayMemories mobile app).
***However, I have been unsuccessful in getting it to work on my iPhone 6S.
***I was never able to record acceptable video with my Canon bodies.
***I soon learned that Canon DSLR's are notoriously awful at video recording.
***I no longer have this issue with the a6000.
***Its quick autofocus does wonders on video as much as it does on stills, and it can record at 1080p, 60 FPS.
***The a6000 does have an in-camera HDR feature that's pretty decent, but since I mostly shoot RAW, I prefer shooting bracketed exposures and merge them later in post-processing as the in-camera HDR only works with JPEG's.
***The camera's articulating screen also comes in very handy when shooting at extreme angles, although it cannot be flipped all the way out for selfies.
***A smaller camera body obviously results in a smaller battery footprint.
***Since the a6000 packs so much power in such a portable body, battery life is unexceptional.
***The average battery life on the Canon 6D is rated at about 950 shots per charge, whereas the a6000 is rated at 310 shots on the view finder and 360 in live view.
***Fortunately, third-party batteries for the a6000 are very inexpensive.
***The trade-off was worth it in exchange for actual video recording ability, better quality photos, and significantly better continuous shooting speed.
***Now for crop factor.
***A full frame camera sensor is the same size as a 35 mm frame of film.
***The Sony a6000's APS-C sensor is 1.5 times smaller, so photos will have a narrower field of view.
***For example, a 14 mm lens on my Canon 6D has a 14 mm field of view since the 6D is a full frame camera.
***On the a6000, the same 14 mm lens will actually give me a field of view equivalent to 21 mm on full frame (14 x 1.5).
***Although the focal length is the same, the a6000's field of view will be tighter because of its smaller sensor size.
***This is a disadvantage to some, but for me, it was another trade-off I was personally willing to make because of how awesome the a6000 is.
***Just like I had no regrets buying the Canon 6D as it is a great camera in its own right, I have no regrets selling the 6D for the sake of adapting to the future of photography.
***My a6000 is pumping out better quality images and performing nearly as good at high ISO than my former camera body.
***I've yet to use it in more real world scenarios, but so far, I'm very impressed despite trading off battery life and crop factor.
***For over half the price of my previous setup, I couldn't go wrong.
***This is the perfect camera for the enthusiast and professional alike.
***In the case of the Sony a6000, big things really do come in small packages.
***My worst purchase on Amazon.com.
***I bought a new Sony Alpha a6000 bundled with a lens from Sony fulfilled by Amazon Prime.
***It was a Black Friday deal so I saved some.
***When the camera arrived, it was obvious that it wasn't new.
***There was no seal on the box, the camera had hair, finger prints and small scratches.
***I called Amazon customer service and reported the problem.
***I was offered to return it or replace it, but I would lose promotional value.
***I have saved about $150 on the Black Friday deal, so I decided to keep the camera even though I was very disappointed as i was supposed to get a new camera for a good price, but instead I got a used one for a fair price.
***Some time later, when I needed to use the camera, I realized that the camera was malfunctioning - the screen turns off whenever you are holding the camera at an angle sharper than 90 degrees.
***It makes it very hard to use this camera, as the screen shuts down basically every time when I try to take a picture.
***By the time I realized that the camera was malfunctioning, 30-day period was already over, so I am stuck with this purchase.
***I don't understand why would Amazon send me a used camera, when I bought a new camera.
***Upd: Since I wrote my review I learned that it is a software malfunction that makes my screen shut down.
***Other users have experienced this problem and it does not seem to be a solution so far.
***Attached are the pictures taken with my Sony Alpha a6000 with the lens it comes with.
***The photos were adjusted in Adobe Lightroom.
***This camera is amazing.
***I upgraded from a Nikon and love the fast shutter speed on this camera.
***It captures great photos of my extremely quick toddlers who never seem to stop moving.
***This is the best camera for the money.
***For landscape, portrait and general shootings... (except for low light conditions vs other DSLR) this is the best camera I'd ever used; with so many in camera adjustment options the photos came out beautifully.
***Although it take some times to get used to the camera, there's no other that I wanted better.
***Love this camera!
***Converted from Nikon DSLR.
***The ability to see changes with the electronic viewfinder and focus zoom has really changed my abilities in photography.
***Takes great photos with good glass.
***Sold all my canon gear to switch over to Sony mirrorless and I won't be looking back any time soon.
***I love this camera.
***Make the switch.
***You won't regret it.
***One of the better cameras I've owned.
***Went from a NEX-6 to this one.
***Much nicer menus, very responsive, nice controls and layout.
***As an interim camera before moving to a professional full frame camera you cannot beat the power for the price.
***For my needs 24.1mp at 11 frames a second has allowed me to take incredible sports photography as well as amazing surreal fine art photography.
***By running adapters you can use any number of old inexpensive glass to transform the look of your images without having to break the bank and the e glass designed for the camera tends to be on the less expensive side without sacrificing power.
***daughter loves it
***First of all i did not trusted at all for A Sony cam to be so good ..
***I always thought th camera brands like Canon are the REAL deal ...
***I'm not a professional photographer but this camera does a great job.
***I just got back from a vacation, i played lill bit with t camera & I shoot some picts .
***... mention that i used the standard  16-50mm lens with a UV filter on  & i improved t contrast from computer JUST a Lill bit @ the Grand Canion pict, the standard lent is not so sharp & hope u guys don't take it as cheating.
***...
***Anyway  rest of pictures are &#34;untouched&#34; .
***I love this camera, the size is perfect it i not as bulky as the Nikon DSLR's.
***I also love the color I have the white one and it looks very nice!
***The picture quality is very nice, the pictures comes up very sharp and colorful, there is no need to edit.
***Overall this camera is very good one of the best out there!
***I found this product to be a disappointment, shots are often blurred or simply don't look good.
***I tried the Alpha A7 II and it was significantly better!
***!
***I've been through many cameras over the past few years and none has been &#34;it&#34; like this Alpha a6000.
***It produces the closest images I've seen to professional quality from a compact camera.
***The one area I find that competitors beat it though is in wi fi connection.
***It's not nearly as smooth or intuitive as my OMD-EM10 was in pairing with my phone.
***At the end of the day though, image quality is what matters here.
***The a6000 is leagues above the a57, em10, and nex5 that I've owned in the past few years.
***The interface is easy to learn and offers just the right amount of control without being too complicated for those of us that aren't pros with a need to tinker with everything.
***I haven't explored all the options on this camera but I have taken some very nice pics with it.
***Mainly portrait type photos, like family members.
***I ordered this during a package sale and ordered just the camera and basic lens, bag, gift card and memory.
***I also ordered a larger memory card and battery charger with 2 batteries.
***I had second thoughts after placing the order, but before it had been shipped.
***I tried to reach someone to ask about adding the zoom lens as well since I realized it was a bargain at only an additional $150 added to the package.
***I could not reach anyone that spoke English well enough to understand my problem and my question, &#34;Was it an option to still add the zoom lens to the package and pay the difference for the upgraded package since that was a different package offered at the time I ordered it.&#34; After some explaining, I was afraid my current package was going to be canceled so I ended up stressing that the package I ordered was fine and I wanted no changes.
***A little disappointing but the camera was in good shape and I think I will be very happy with it once I have had the opportunity to use it more.
***The basic lens really has very little zoom so be aware of this if you order it.
***My issue was more with the Amazon order modifying process than the actual item being reviewed.
***Not satisfied with the quality of the photos.
***Compared to my old Canon Power Shot, this camera has poor color capture and poor clarity.
***I returned,because the lens doesn't work as should.
***The a6000 is an amazing camera for the price.
***The internet is replete with favorable accounts and reviews for this APC-S mirrorless gem, so I won't waste time recapping all the pluses well documented on the internet,
***Bought this during the thanksgiving bundle... and love it.
***This is my first interchangeable lens camera and I am happy I choose A6000.
***Compact and its lighter so easy to carry it around.
***I was looking forward to the wireless transfer feature.
***It turns out that it does not work on a macbook pro (strangely, it does work on other apple products with the same system).
***Sony views this as Apple's fault and suggested I buy a different computer.
***That is not the kind of customer service I am looking for.
***I upgraded to this camera from an older model, so I was able to use my lenses I already had.
***I absolutely LOVE this camera!

***I also like the new button they added to quickly switch to video or to rotate through the different modes without having to play with the digital screen.
***I bought this camera on January 16 through Amazon.
***I started to have issues with the screen since I opened it.
***I even opened a ticket to return the item to Amazon because I was seeing some weird lines on the screen.
***While I was chatting with the support person from Amazon to return the camera, I turned it off for 1 minute and then turned it back on and the lines were gone so I closed the ticket and kept the camera.
***This problem has escalated, Now the screen darkens to around 25% of the normal brightness and the lines are very very visible, this happens after around 30 seconds of turning it on.
***I sent this case to Amazon on March 24 but they said they cannot change the item due to the fact that it was over 30 days after buying it.
***This even after I specifically clarified that I had opened up an issue with them since day one, the camera obviously had some problems since the start that have escalated.
***I am based in Colombia, South America and now I cannot get the camera repaired here, they say that Sony does not have global support por its prouducts so they would charge me (as much as the body costs brand new) to repair it.
***For two days now Ive been trying to get a hold of Sony Support in the US to see how to send my camera, their phone support is just collapsed and I havent been able to speal to a human being.
***Amazon pulled through and allowed me to return the item for a refund.
***But Sony's support was really dissapointing.
***Thanks amazon!
***This camera is amazing.

***I purchased this camera in Nov 2015 however I have not used it too often.
***After a few use lately, I found the battery would be exhausted if I left it in the camera for 3 to 5 days.
***If I left it in there for a month and the better died, I wouldn't be so surprised.
***I don't know if this is a common issue for this camera or just mine is defective.
***I'm totally disappointed for this product.
***I'm an experienced professional photog and designer.
***At first let me preface this by saying that camera worked GREAT, picture quality was high, the high speed AF was really impressive.
***However, after literally an hour of use, it craps out.
***Right after snapping a shot it freezes and shows this error &#34;camera error, turn camera off and on.&#34; I follow directions, speak to customer support, etc.
***Sony customer support says that I have send the camera in for service (takes 7-10 business days upon arrival of the facility).
***I'm sorry no one has time for that, and in my particular case this was going to be used specifically for an upcoming trip.
***Don't just take my word for it.
***If you google the error, you'll find multiple people that encountered the same problem and in some cases it happened in the middle of their trip.
***Luckily, I purchased this a few weeks ahead of time.
***Don't let this happen to you, I recommend sticking to more reliable cameras manufactures such as Nikon and Canon.
***For a brand new product, this is just unacceptable.
***This was supposed to be a high-end, future of DSLR camera, and mine turned out to be cheap and defective.
***Not satisfied with the quality of the photos.
***Compared to my old Canon Power Shot, this camera has poor color capture and poor clarity.

***Excellent camera.
***I think best crop sensor camera for the price range.
***But, If u have the cash the a7ii is much better in terms of egonomics and features.
***That said the sony a6300 has included some of features that i would have really liked to see in the a6000.
***First off!
***THANK YOU Sony for releasing such an amazing product!
***Okay so anyone looking to buy this camera let me tell you right now nothing compares to this camera even in a higher bracket EXCEPT for the newly so to be released  A7000 (not a replacement for this camera just a higher bracket camera with 4K video) the pictures I have taken with this camera even starting off as an amateur resorting to Youtube have been beyond impressive, I now have a canvas collection that I started for the house and everyone is always blow away that I have taken these photos, I am always being offered money for my canvas prints.
***The date is 3/3/16 and this is still by far the best bang for the buck you can buy SPEND THE MONEY!
***You will love this camera and how fun it is to tinker with, the community and support for this product is HUGE!
***I have owned this camera for over a year and have much more expensive cameras and I consistently choose this camera in almost every situation then my higher end ones.
***PS no longer a Canon fan boy.
***I`m not a professional photographer but this camera takes some very good pictures, don`t let the size fool you.
***I recently took this camera on a trip to Italy and took it everywhere I went without being bothered by the weight of the camera and got some awesome pictures on the trip, I would highly recommend getting this camera.
***You can also use old manual lenses from Minolta, Olympus, Nikon e.t.c.
***with the fairly inexpensive adapters available so you can have some excellent  quality manual lenses for a fraction of the price.
***I love it and would recommend it to family and friends.
***This camera is with no doubt one the greatest bang for your buck you can get!
***The sensor on it is unbelievable.
***Look up some star time laps videos of this camera on youtube.
***The photo I attached is one that was taken at 1am.
***I am a beginner and I love this camera so far!
***I am a photographer by trade but I decided I needed a travel camera.
***This thing fits the bill.
***The only thing I don't love is how it performs in low light situations.
***It seems to have trouble focusing.
