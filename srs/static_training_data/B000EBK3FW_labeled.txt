size***This fine little camera just earned a glowing nod in the June, 2006 issue of Popular Photography, for which it was praised for its relatively fast, relatively fixed maximum aperture of f3.3 (35mm equivalent zoom range is 36-432 mm, with the maximum aperture varying from f2.8 to 3.3) at 420mm.
design***Ergonomically it may resemble a digital SLR only in the sense that its controls are easy to reach and use.
pictures***Like other recent Panasonic Lumix cameras, this one has a superb image stabilization feature for handholding under low light conditions or fast-paced action shots with an equivalent film speed of up to ISO 1600!
battery***In plain English, this is the perfect little digital camera for taking pictures under almost every condition imaginable, with an ample power supply from its Lithium battery.
pictures***The Leica-designed, Panasonic-built zoom lens offers exceptional image quality.
no feature***I've had this camera two weeks now, and have had no problems whatsoever with it.
no feature***It's my first digital camera, and so I spent about a month shopping around, reading various reviews, checking what needs I had in a camera, etc.
no feature***When I knew that I wanted a megazoom, I ended up narrowing my selections to a few cameras: Sony DSC-H2, Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ7, Canon S3IS, and Fuji FinePix s5200.
no feature***All of them are great cameras and review well.
no feature***In many of the reviews I would regularly read of each owner praising their own camera over the traits of the others.
no feature***I don't know about anyone else, but I can't afford to own one of each camera to really know what that's like.
no feature***What I took it to mean was that most of the people who bought any of these cameras were very happy with them.
no feature***In some ways it made things more difficult (which one should I get?
no feature***), but then in other ways it was a destresser (at least I won't get a dud, whichever I end up with).
no feature***Going to the stores around here and getting a feel for them in my hand was important.
no feature***Everyone's hands are different, so it won't help for people to know which felt comfy in my hands, but I'll say it was a factor.
no feature***Features-wise, these cameras are all in the same neighbourhood.
ease of use***Big zoom, mid-high megapixel, and plenty of user-control when it comes to the settings.
screen***The viewscreens vary in size, as does the onboard memory, the kind of memory cards and batteries the camera uses, etc., so these are the major distinctions.
zoom***Lenses on these cameras are also very good, no matter which you're looking at.
no feature***Fuji and Canon, for instance, are both camera companies before they were into electronics, and Sony uses the Carl Zeiss and Panasonic uses the Leica.
no feature***Quibble if you must about the lens quality of one vs. another, but the differences are minute.
pictures***All offer some form of image stabilization as well, which is most helpful to me and my big, shaky hands.
no feature***When decision time came, price became a factor.
price***The Fuji and Canon were $50-100 more than the Sony, and the Panasonic was another 20 below the Sony.
no feature***Again, it wasn't the only factor, but it was in there.
battery***Other factor: Power source.
battery***Some cameras run off AA batteries (Sony and Canon, not sure about Fuji), the Panasonic uses a Panasonic brand battery (Lithium-Ion), but you can buy knock-off brands that are much cheaper.
battery***They don't last as long (I have two) as the Panasonic, but I would say they are about 90% of the shooting capacity of the one that came with the camera, at about a fifth of the cost.
other features***And last but not least: Storage.
price***Panasonic and Canon use SD cards, which are cheap and fast.
price***The Sony uses MemoryStick (a Sony product) that costs more.
other features***Not sure on it's performance, but from what I could tell from other reviews, a highspeed (UltraII by Sandisk, for instance) SD card was more than adequate.
no feature***I got a 1G UltraII SD card and it holds 334 pics at max resolution.
no feature***It's a fine performer, and fits into my laptop's cardreader.
no feature***Very fast transfer from card to CPU for editing and such.
no feature***Way faster than the included USB cable.
battery***With the Panasonic, I make the tradeoff that memory is relatively cheap and flexible with other cameras and computers, but I have to have my batteries charged and ready for picture taking.
battery***With the Sony I could have gone to any corner store most anywhere in the world and picked up two AA's to operate the camera.
battery***They don't last as long as NiMH AA's, but they'll work fine when you have no other choice.
battery***To me that was a trade I'm willing to make, since I have three batteries (each rated for 270-300) and being able to acquire more storage cheaply would be better for what I need.
pictures***If you get this camera, you will be very pleased with the pictures you take, though that doesn't mean that you would be displeased with the others I mentioned.
no feature***Make sure you get a chance to hold the cameras in your hand, and see what your priorities are going to be in picture taking.
battery***If you're always on the road and charging batteries is a problem, this camera might not be the one for you (charging the battery for this camera takes 2 hours), but if that isn't an issue, this camera is an excellent choice.
pictures***The only criticism people have had of this camera has been 'noise' at high ISOs, but that's not something I've noticed.
no feature***I'll be doing some night shooting soon, so I'll experiment and see what I can get.
no feature***As for the other positive reviews of picture quality, clarity, colour reproduction, etc.
no feature***- I echo those heartily.
no feature***Again, this is not a camera that disappoints.
no feature***You'll be very pleased with the results.
no feature***Happy shooting!
no feature***This camera replaces 35 year old Nikons with all the lenses etc that were available at that time.
no feature***I have been reluctant to join the digital camera set.
no feature***This Panasonic is simply an outstanding product.
size***In one small package you replace many heavy lenses and two Nikons I have been carrying.
no feature***Prior to my purchase I tried to research hard and read mostly positive reviews on this camera.
no feature***They were absolutely correct and many of the negative comments have turned out to be either very very picky or simply not reading the manual.
quality***The strong suits to this Panasonic FZ7 for me are the portrait and macro quality.
zoom***The Leica lens is excellent and the results are excellent.
no feature***I have now taken over 400 pictures with this camera and had one portrait printed by a custom lab.
no feature***They were impressed also.
no feature***Portraits are just outstanding and so are close-ups such as mountain wild flowers.
ease of use***The ease of use is outstanding.
ease of use***Yes you have to read the manual and yes you have to do some practicing but you get out of this camera what you put into it.
battery***Battery life is outstanding.
battery***I love the provided battery and don't want to be carrying AA batteries.
battery***Charging for 2 hours from completely dead is impressive and being able to take several hundred photos on one charge sold me.
other features***For the most part the software that comes with it is good although I am not sure why you would need 4 different photo programs and it seems they could have put their effort into just one great photo program.
other features***For the amateur photographer I consider this camera to be outstanding as long as you will study the manual and try the different settings.
other features***There are many settings and they do produce the desired results.
no feature***There is, of course, a "simple" setting which frankly I haven't tried yet because this camera is so easy to use the more advanced settings.
no feature***For an old film camera guy its a joy to take as many pictures as I want and delete the bad ones.
no feature***Seeing your results instantly is impressive and its so easy to watch on your TV that was actually the first place we did watch.
screen***I also find the view finder to be an absolute joy.
screen***The LCD screen is more than adequate for most conditions but I find that in bright sunlight(sun behind you) the view finder is such a joy that I find myself using it more and more.
screen***The detailed information available within the view finder is in such sharp detail its amazing.
no feature***Didn't know that was possible.
size***The arguments against this camera might be that it doesn't fit into your pocket but its so lightweight and the 12X zoom is so impressive I love to carry it.
no feature***I bought a small case for it that fits it nice and tight and at Sam's Club I bought a 1GB Toshiba high proformance SD card for under $50.
no feature***The 1GB card matches the battery capacity at best quality for about 329 pictures at 6M megapixels.
no feature***Absolutely no regrets about purchasing this camera.
video***I was into my third day with it before I even tried the audio.
no feature***Who knew?
no feature***Good idea!
pictures***Another really unreal idea is stabilization in a still camera.
zoom***When you are out on the 12X zoom its very impressive.
no feature***Haven't used a tripod yet and for wildflowers the Nikon just about had to be on a tripod when using the Micro Nikkor lens in wind etc.
no feature***All of my Nikons will soon be featured on E-Bay.
no feature***First though there is this 12 day vacation through 3 Natl Parks.
no feature***Hmmm taking my laptop so I can download the SD card because I am thinking at least 1,000 pictures!
price***It all came down to either this Panasonic or the Canon S3IS with comparable bells and whistles but the Cannon was over a $100 more and I couldn't justify it.
no feature***This camera will basically take your picture for you if you use all of its capability.
no feature***In January, my beloved Canon s-45 received the dreaded E-18 error.
no feature***At two hundred dollars, it is not worth repairing.
no feature***I am joining the class action law suit on that Canon camera error (Google for more info if you have that problem).
no feature***So I set out to find a viable substitute.
no feature***I purchased a Pentax Optio S-6.
no feature***Very unhappy.
quality***Outdoor pictures were clear but indoor pictures, terrible quality.
screen***We used the camera at a birthday party, put it back in its case and into a purse, and for some inexplicable reason, the LCD screen 'cracked'.
no feature***So, I returned it.
no feature***Turns out that is a common and fatal flaw for that camera.
price***I went to Frys and talked to several people who reccommended that for the money, the Panasonic was the best deal.
pictures***My main goal for the camera is to shoot indoor club volleyball action shots with some degree of sharpness and quality.
no feature***I realize it would not be the performance of my friends several thousand dollar camera systems, but I wanted something that would 'do'.
no feature***Well, in this Panasonic, I FOUND IT!
pictures***I have had it for a week, and have test run it in every situation, night, action, inside, outside, object, people.
ease of use***The instruction manual is a bit difficult to read, a little confusing, but once you figure out what you are doing, the camera is a real delight.
pictures***The inside volleyball shots I got are even more than I'd hoped for.
pictures***I have one fun shot that captured no less than four volleyballs in the air, clearly.
no feature***That was just a bonus to the player I was shooting.
pictures***Don't get me wrong, you cannot get an action still like something you'd see in the newspaper, but you can get something almost as good.
no feature***I am very happy with this camera.
no feature***I have decided to keep it, and am going out to purchase a good case today.
no feature***Additionally, we are so happy that we went out and purchased the Panasonic DMC-FX9 for my 22 year old daughter.
no feature***Her friend has a slightly older model (also a former Canon user) and is thrilled with it.
no feature***We are very happy with that purchase as well.
no feature***Again, this is not a camera for those looking for the sports page spectaculars.
quality***This is a camera for a person looking to have good quality photos of their every day activities that come out clear, sharp and crisp.
no feature***Good luck!
no feature***Karen
no feature***An elderly friend of mine is just getting his toes wet with his spiffy new laptop,spiffy new 3-in -one printer,and this very,very sweet camera.
no feature***He is a retired art instructor,and was a professional photographer back in the days of the Rolliflexes.
no feature***He asked for my help in selecting all of the above,and I have to tell you: This camera has knocked his socks off.
quality***He is trying everything the camera is capable of,and he is continually amazed at the quality,heft,and pictures the Lumix can take.
no feature***Being very mechanically-minded,he is just as intrigued with its operations ,as he is with the finished print.
no feature***As for my opinion??
no feature***I wish I had one of these!
size***I have a very nice pocket-size Nikon,5.1mp,and I bought it so I could carry it in my pocket.
pictures***It takes wonderful photos,so I really don't need this one.
no feature***But..
ease of use***I like the fact that you can override the auto settings and tweak it to your specifications.
no feature***He has been having a lot of fun with it over the past couple of weeks.
no feature***Taking photos in all sorts of light situations.
no feature***Moon photos,sunsets,etc.
no feature***I think he will continue to be very pleased with what he has purchased.
screen***It was so nice to see his face light up the first time he took a photo and looked at it in the very huge LCD screen.
no feature***I suggest,as amazon did,that you get a 1Gig SD card,minimum,but if you can swing it,go for the 2Gig.
no feature***All-in-all,this is a great camera,and coupled with a spiffy,high-quality printer,anyone into photography will be pleased.
no feature***After nearly 3 months of research, I convinced myself that this camera was the best choice out of all the options I had considered.
no feature***I had been a digital camera user for about 3 years, just using point and shoot cameras.
no feature***This camera (along with other super zooms) is a good way to graduate between traditional point-and-shoot cameras and dSLR cameras.
price***Ironically, this model camera happens to be the cheapest along with the one with the best reviews and most features.
no feature***The Canon S3 seems to be the typical consumer choice, yet this camera has a very odd form factor, and once I picked it up I knew it wasn't right for me.
ease of use***The interface on the software side was confusing and far too "dumbed-down" for me.
pictures***Some test images at the store came out with a fair amount of noise, which is ironic due to the fact that all the camera gurus complain about the extreme noise on this camera.
pictures***The noise on this camera is there, but not as noticeable as some reviewers make it sound.
pictures***To put it into perspective, the noise levels are basically viewable in anything above a 11x14 print.
pictures***Picture quality is strong in nearly all modes, and when you don't know what to use, there is usually a scene mode that will take care of it.
no feature***Of course, you can always enter Simple Mode, something I personally have never tried, but how bad could it be.
design***In respect to the features of this camera, the form factor, to start out, is amazing.
size***Although it may not look like much, the camera can easily be held with one hand by someone with small hands like myself or large ones like those of my father.
screen***On the backside, there is the huge 2.5 inch LCD screen (once again complained about by pro reviewers as not sharp enough, wrong again).
ease of use***Also, a simple set of navigational arrows, a trash button, the EVF, power switch, flash pop button, and a unique joystick that gives you access to all manual controls while in manual modes.
ease of use***The joystick is really great, allowing access to all the manual features whenever I need them.
zoom***The 12x Optical Zoom is truly amazing, I can sit in my room and zoom so far with such great clarity that my camera can read things that I can't, and I have vision that is far above average.
zoom***The Leica lens is obviously crafted beautifully, like that of the $4000 cameras that Leica makes.
no feature***This camera allows a great deal of diversity for experienced users, while also offering options for those who are not as experienced.
zoom***I would highly recommend this camera to anyone who might want to get closer to the shot with the huge zoom or wants to graduate from point and shoot cameras.
no feature***I resisted providing a review of this camera for about 2 months now in order to make sure everything was as I would like it.
no feature***I can now say that this camera is a great choice for those that are looking for a trade-off between ultra-compact, and long-zoom SLR.
no feature***I recently took it to a Black Eyed Peas concert that was in the evening.
zoom***The pictures I took at 12x zoom were really good.
screen***The large screen is perfect for sharing with friends immediately.
ease of use***The simple mode is good for taking most pictures, and if you like to fiddle, it's got just enough of the manual features to give you those options.
size***It's considerably lighter than a digi-SLR, with a better form-factor (I think) than either the Canon S3 or Sony H2.
no feature***I would definitely recommend.
no feature***I am not a techno geek.
no feature***I lean towards electronically challanged.
ease of use***What I can tell you is that this camera is extremely user friendly.
other features***It has a multitude of modes to shoot in, such as starry night; fireworks; snow; portrait; and baby.
no feature***All with subtle little adjustments that will enchance the scene you are trying to capture.
pictures***It takes spectacular photos and the prints are rich and clean and clear and brilliant.
no feature***This is my first upgrade from a 2mp.
no feature***I considered the Sony's and the Cannon's, seriously.
size***When I saw the size of this one, I was sold.
size***It is "almost" a compact and can be taken any where any time.
no feature***Do your techno research, then, try it.
no feature***You won't be disappointed.
no feature***After extensive research, this camera was the best buy for the feature set by far.
zoom***The closest competitor in my research was the Canon S3 IS for over $150 more.12x zoom is unbeatable, many manual settings, image stabilization, great flash, burst mode, solid construction, nice "gimmicks" like child age and day of vacation recording are cool.
screen***Big 2.5 in screen and fast fast focus/writing to mem card are highly valued.
screen***The only negatives I can think of are low-ish LCD screen resolution and no built-in lens cover, but this really has the feel of a camera one slight step below a professional SLR.
no feature***This is my second camera upgrading from a Fuji basic digital camera, and there's a world of difference.
no feature***I've had this camera for a little under a month.
no feature***It was an upgrade from a 4 year old 4MP camera that I still love.
no feature***However, I've already put this camera through its paces.
no feature***I've taken almost 1k pictures and outside of a few that were out of focus (because of me) they all have turned out great.
no feature***I've shot everything from close up flowers, my son playing, my car after a wax to an entire wedding and reception.
no feature***First impressions aside, this camera is easy to fall in love with.
ease of use***Nutz and BoltzI wont kid you, the learning curve is two fold and a little steep.
other features***There's an "easy" mode with included button(just like those Staples commercials) which out of the box makes the camera almost fool proof.
no feature***Using the other settings takes a while to get used to, and even after a month of shooting, there is still stuff I don't know how to access on the fly.
pictures***PictureIn bright sun light the picture quality is simply amazing.
pictures***Spot on colr and exposure.
pictures***The images I've captured outdoors have been some of the best, crips and vivid.
pictures***Indoors with a flash you get good pictures but nothing spectacular, It is though more then what a good point and shoot would produce.
pictures***Cons:At high ISO settings picture quality starts to get a little grainy, but when you resize the image to something smaller, alot of the picture noise is removed.
pictures***Also as I've read on other sites a good noise reduction tool (software) is probably a must with any camera over 4MP.
detection***Can be slow to auto focus at times, so you may miss a shot.
detection***However, it has continuous AF which can really help.
pictures***Pros:Great picture quality, high ISO settings which can be noisy do capture pictures you wouldn't normally have gotten any other way.
ease of use***Small joystick that gives you quick access to manual focus, exposure settings and other cool features.
video***Captures quicktime video at 640x480 @30f and is pretty good at it.
no feature***(About 11m for 1gig of SD media)Overall score 9.5 stars I love it!
no feature***Having outgrown my 3mp Olympus point-and-shoot-and-pray camera, I did a bunch of research and settled on the FZ7.
no feature***It promised the best bang for the buck in high-midrange cameras--and boy does it deliver.
pictures***Outdoors, in pretty much any light, it takes beautiful, crips shots.
other features***The aperature- or shutter-priority modes allow you a lot of control over photographic effects, and are a great lesson in photography for those of us raised on fully-auto cameras.
pictures***I took it to a Memorial Day party this weekend and shot a bunch of shots that all turned out beautifully, without really needing to think about the settings at all.
no feature***Indoors, prepare for the flash, or invest in a tripod.
no feature***While there may be occasionaly indoor shots with sufficient ambient light to shoot by, longer shutter speeds strain the image stabilization to the limits.
no feature***Fortunately, you can manually set the flash temperature.
pictures***I've been able to produce several nicely moody interior photos with a cool flash and a hand-tweaked exposure level.
pictures***It's true--you'll read it here and other places as you research this camera--that grain and noise can be an issue under low-light conditions.
no feature***I've overcome that by hand-setting the ISO to a lower sensitivity and correcting the exposure to match.
no feature***If you don't want to use my flash level adjustment trick I mentioned above, but are bound and determined to shoot under live light, you can get a decently noise-free shot, but it will take some manual fiddling.
no feature***One feature that I didn't see mentioned anywhere is the battery life on this thing.
battery***I've owned the camera for just over a week, and according to the on-screen battery meter, I'm still 2/3 charged on my first charge.
battery***I bought a second battery, because I hate downtime, but I almost can't imagine needing it.
video***Also, the video quality is great--and the sound this thing captures with its videos is remarkable.
no feature***All in all, a very nice camera.
no feature***My first digital camera was a 3.2 mb 3x optical HP...
no feature***Simple, fit the bill, happy.
no feature***Two months later...outgrown it.
battery***Used rechargeble AA's, which required constant recharging.
screen***When using viewfinder, view didn't change as I zoomed, so margins were off.
pictures***Action pix...forget about it!Next, moved up to a 4 mb 4x optical Kodak.
no feature***Again, simple fit the bill, but overall, outgrown in cpl of weeks.
size***Didn't want (or need) all the features of a bulky Digi SLR, but instead something lightweight w/good optical zoom and features.
no feature***Basically good balance, ya know?
no feature***Something easy enough to understand for electronic novices, but with USEFUL features.
no feature***Just before a trip to NYC (4/20/06), stopped in Circuit City.
no feature***With a "sea" of "open box" cameras, I asked the sales rep to recommend the best value for the dollar.
no feature***I purchased this camera (on reps strong recommendation) at $249 (with FULL INTENT to return it w/n 2 weeks...as I have w/other Circuit City buys).
ease of use***Some features were intuitive, other's required a "quick trip" to the owners' manual.
zoom***Digital zoom and anti-shake...
no feature***AWESOME!
size***!Surprisingly lightweight!!
battery***Battery lasted entire 5 day trip and some!The more features I read about (and used), I discovered this is the ONE!!
no feature***Has room to grow with many "near future" features.
pictures***Action pics are unbelievable!
video***Used the digital camcorder feature for "short snippets"....nice!
battery***!...and still strong battery strength.
no feature***This open box buy was NOT returned!
no feature***After a lot of research, I bought the DMC FZ7.
no feature***It has a lot going for it.
pictures***Virtually every review, including the one in the June 2006 Popular Photography, comments on the amount of noise the camera produces.
no feature***In fact, the Popular Photography review test found the noise level to be "high/unacceptable" at every ISO except for 100.
no feature***Other reviews found that it would produce acceptable prints up to 5x7 at higher ISOs (while finding the "high sensitivity modes" with ISO up to 1600 to be unusable).
pictures***Notwithstanding the noise problem, the camera is said to have good color and a fabulous optically stabilized zoom lense.
pictures***So, it can capture good images.
no feature***What to do about the noise?Many people post process their digital photos.
no feature***The programs Neat Image and Noise Ninja are widely cited, and many reviewers indicated that Neat Image does a good job of cleaning up the FZ7's noisy images.
no feature***Noise Ninja appears to be faster but more expensive.
no feature***Thus, if you are going to post process your images anyway (Photoshop Elements 4.0 is one good way to do that), you can invest another $50-$75 or so to get one of these de-noise programs or plug-ins.
no feature***Photoshop Elements 4.0 itself has a de-noising function built in, although it appears not to be as sophisticated as that of the plug-ins.
no feature***If you're willing to take the time, it appears that the FZ7 with noise removal processing can produce really good images, even large ones.
no feature***I have yet to see, but am optimistic.
no feature***Amazon's generous return policy will let me return the camera within 30 days if it doesn't work out.
no feature***If you're using your images for the web, email or small prints, the noise problem isn't such a big deal.
price******The price dropped at Amazon $18 about a week after I bought it.
no feature***Amazon promptly credited me with the difference.
no feature***Another reason to buy from Amazon (and to check prices after your purchase).
no feature***After testing this camera out on some landscape shots, I decided to try it out on something difficult -- a Def Leppard concert.
no feature***My seats were about 20 rows back, so I needed the zoom at or near maximum and had to shoot in low (and constantly changing) light with no flash.
no feature***And of course I had no tripod and had to work around the arms and other appendages of the fans in front of me.
pictures***Despite these less-than-optimal conditions, I got great results, including a few near professional quality pics.
zoom***The zoom performed very well, and the shutter priority setting allowed me to shoot everything at 1/60 sec (the slowest I dared use without a tripod).
pictures***The built-in antishake feature helped a lot.
pictures***While some pics were blurry, plenty of them turned out crisp, clear, and well-lit.
pictures***Some other reviewers have complained about noise at ISO higher than 100, but I shot at ISO 400 and got good results (though I haven't printed enlargements yet).
no feature***Any camera that can handle constantly-moving targets under constantly changing stage lights with the zoom fully extended is a keeper!
no feature***I've had 2 SLR cameras and a zoom lens -all Nikons-starting 30 years ago.
no feature***Since I purchased my second camera about 5 years ago, I was resisting the switch to digital.
price***I can't express more enthusiastically how happy I am with this camera!Amazon made it easier with their excellent price (it was much lower than other stores at the time of my purchase) and their liberal return policy.
pictures***I've shot hundreds of pix and have been blown away with the results!Macro has yielded incredible butterfly and bee shots.
pictures***Flowers and fall leaves are spectacular.
pictures***Interiors are true to life and I've gotten excellent sports shots insde rather dimly lit areas using high sensitivity.
zoom***I'm very satisfied with the zoom, too.
no feature***It's so much fun to experiment without the guilt associated with paying for developing many rolls of film to get a great shot.
no feature***Are my results professional quality?
no feature***Probably not.
no feature***Are they applauded by friends and family?
no feature***Definitely!Am I dreaming of a DSLR?
no feature***Not yet!
no feature***I loved the FZ5 but up'ed to the FZ7 not for 1 MP but the bigger LCD.
ease of use***To my surprise, I find the menu and button layout improved and intuitive.
size***I can't compare this to similar Sony and Canon offerings but this camera is for sure smaller and very light.
pictures***The image stab is unbelieveable..when I'm hiking at 8 to 12 K feet and stop to take a pix, I'm breathing hard and can see the viewfinder jump in time with my pulse.
pictures***No prob, sqeeze off a shot at ISO 100 and the image is crisp.
no feature***This should have been an 8 MP camera if Panasonic wanted to really wanted offer an "upgrade"...too bad, but for me 6 MP works.
no feature***I've had mine for about a month, and I really like it.
zoom***It is my first long zoom digital camera, and I like all of the things other reviewers noted, but additionally want to note that:1) The FZ7 is smaller and lighter than others in its class2) It feels quite solid.
quality***I've accidently whacked it a few times with no harm.3) It has a variable diopter viewfinder.
no feature***Good for glasses wearers.
no feature***Some don't.
screen***Now the (minor) bad things about the camera.1)  The viewfinder, though better than most, is not as bright or as high resolution as the Kodak P850.
other features***The Kodak also has a better view in low light conditions.
no feature***The P850 is also available for considerable less money, although some think it takes slightly inferior pics.
no feature***Night pictures with this camera are almost an act of faith unless you are in range of the LED.2) You won't find a backlight setting in the Program mode.
no feature***You have to adjust the exposure compensation click by click.
ease of use***I like a single button option for fast compensation.
other features***It is available in the simple mode, which does 90% of what I want anyway, but I use the Program mode most and I think most techie, non pros will too.3) No AA battery option.
no feature***I want to take it on travel and camping.
no feature***It would be nice to be freed of the plug.4) The Aperture and Shutter priority mode are a mystery to me.
no feature***And yes, I've read the manual a few times.
no feature***You still have to adjust to get the proper exposure.
no feature***That's not how I recall it working in my old Ricoh 35mm SLR.
pictures***Beyond these caveats, I have taken some spectacular pictures that people really notice.
other features***Sports mode does great for kids sports.
no feature***And when  you press the shutter, the camera takes a picture!!
no feature***At that moment!!
no feature***Mirabile dictu!
no feature***I've owned this camera for about half a year.
no feature***This is my second digital camera, after the low-end but generally well-regarded Canon A510.
price***This camera is a definite step up in size and price, but I'm not entirely satisfied with it.
pictures***While the overall picture quality is undeniably better than the 510, I think the very large amount of noise almost kills the FZ7.
pictures***This camera shows noise even at ISO 80 and 100, is barely usable at ISO 200, and is kind of a joke at ISO 400.
pictures***The ISO 800 & 1600 modes are fun for taking snapshots in dark areas, but are comparable to a camera-phone in quality.
pictures***The noise problem is mitigated by the excellent image stabilization (which helps by two steps - or being able to use ISO 100 in ISO 400 situations, which is probably a more realistic way to think of it), but only partially.
pictures***The camera also has occasional issues with purple fringing and poor automatic white balance.
screen***Finally, the large display is very low-resolution, and given to weird moray effects.
zoom***On the positive side, it's an excellent lens (which is rather fast, especially on the long end of the zoom), the user interface is rather efficient and easy to use, the build quality is excellent, it feels comfortable in the hand, and it's substantially cheaper than the similar Canon S3.
size***The size is compact enough that it can be squeezed into a pants pocket and definitely fits into a jacket pocket, which greatly increases the chances that I'll take it with me.
pictures***Personally, though, while I enjoy using this camera, I think the image quality is only half a step up from pocket-size cameras, and can't even compete with an entry-level DSLR.
no feature***I needed a camera for a trip to South Colorado/Northern New Mexico.
no feature***I read the reviews on Amazon and decided on this one (although I bought it locally due to time constraints).
no feature***This camera does not dissapoint!
price***A lot of features and a lot of performance for the money.
ease of use***Very intuitive to use, all buttons easy to locate and push.
screen***I love the 2.5" LCD screen and the viewfinder works well in sunny areas.
no feature***Best of all the sunscreen really works to block the sun.
size***It is very lightweight.
battery***Good battery life with proprietary battery--would have preferred AA's--and that is truly my only complaint with this camera.
battery***I bought an extra battery to use with the encloed charger and had no problems switching back and forth.
no feature***Also bought a 1G card which allowed approx 375 photographs.
ease of use***I did some cool artsy shots of crumbling adobe walls and vistas with the manual controls that are also easy to navigate.
ease of use***Got some great wildlife shots too: the camera turns on and is ready to go in two seconds (I just counted).
zoom***The zoom works quickly.
zoom***With the digital zoom it goes to 48X with some degradation that the manual takes pains to warn you about.
zoom***Zoom up to 12x and steady on a car or your buddy and you will get some great shots.
no feature***So.
no feature***.
no feature***.miles ahead of any pocket camera out there.
no feature***I certainly would not compare it to any true SLR in price and versatility.
no feature***It is really an intermediate step between the two.
no feature***For those that want more quality than a pocket camera, but don't want to invest in an SLR this is a real contender.
no feature***I really cannot think of a single serious criticism of this camera.
no feature***The Panasonic DMC-FZ7 is a very nice upgrade from the DMC-FZ5 it replaced, at a much lower cost!
price***It really is amazing how these electronic devices get better and cheaper in a very short time.
pictures***The camera takes great pictures, and is easy to handle.
battery***It operates quickly and comes with a lithium ion rechargable battery that is good for around 300 shots, which is more than you'll probably ever need in one outing.
no feature***[...].
no feature***It wasn't made by Panasonic (that battery costs around [...]) but it works identically to the OEM battery.
other features***The camera uses SD memory cards which are pretty common today and easy to find.
no feature***This camera, like all superzooms, is best when used outdoors.
pictures***Nature photography, landscapes, and anything where there is plenty of light comes out great.
zoom***The weakness of cameras with a long zoom range is indoor available light shooting, because the compromises needed in making such a powerful lens in a small package.
zoom***The lens simply isn't fast enough for indoor, low light or available light shooting.
no feature***However, if you use the flash this won't be a problem.
no feature***A tripod would also help.
no feature***But it should be noted that this problem exists for any superzoom camera, not just this one.
zoom***The lens itself is beautiful... Leica designed, and Panasonic built.
pictures***it provides sharp, well saturated pictures with very little distortion except at the extreme high end of the zoom range.
no feature***I didn't detect any major purple fringing problem.
size***Panasonics use a relatively small image sensor, which is needed to keep the camera size and weight down.
pictures***So, this camera like all Panasonics, is often said to have "High (image) noise over 200 ISO."
pictures***And this is true, but it is hardly noticable unless you make huge enlargements or shoot over 400 ISO.
no feature***Also, if you do find any noise, it is easily removed by Photo Shop or Print Shop software.
no feature***I suspect this problem isn't that easy to engineer out in small sensor cameras, or Panasonic would have done it by now.
no feature***Panasonic's OIS (Optical Image Stabilization) system works extremely well.
pictures***It is built into the lens, and actually moves the elements to compensate for camera shake.
zoom***This becomes a critical issue for long focal lenght zoom lenses.
no feature***Note... unlike some manufacturers, Panasonic uses a REAL stabilization system.
other features***This isn't a program that merely raises the ISO to increase the shutter speed, but an actual anti-shake correction, just like the high end Canon L series IS lenses have.
no feature***Here are the improvements Panasonic made over the FZ5 with this new FZ7:1.
pictures***6MP rather than 5MP2.
screen***2.5 inch LCD screen rather than 2.0 inch screen3.
battery***Better, longer lasting battery4.
design***Threaded front lens element to accept filters5.
video***Better movie resolution (TWICE as good)6.
design***Lens cap attaches to camera, so it's hard to lose7.
pictures***Able to take 16:9 ratio pictures8.
pictures***Can shoot above ISO400 (but 800 and 1600 are lower resolution)9.
no feature***60 sec min shutter rather than 8 secAll for around [...] FZ5 which was only released 11 months before the FZ7!Overall, this is a great camera that will please any casual shooter or advanced amatuer.
price***It does a lot in a very small package, for a very reasonable price.
pictures***Pros will be disappointed by it's low light results and noise problems at higher ISO's.
no feature***But, if you are a professional photographer, you wouldn't even consider one of these cameras.
no feature***You'd be using a Digital SLR, and hauling around 50 pounds worth of gear!Given the rapid technological advances made in these cameras, I refuse to spend [...] for a camera that will be obsolete in 3 years.
no feature***But this little gem was only [...] from Amazon, and will probably be even lower by the time you read this review.
no feature***I'd rather buy a new camera every 3 years for that same [...], and get all the latest improvements!
screen***Pluses- Good Build- Great Zoom Lens- Quick poweron and multi shot mode- Wide screen 848 x 480 (16:9) 30fps videoMinus- Icons on buttons wore out after 1 week :-(- Sometimes not able to focus properly in low light/close rangeNo regrets in purchasing this camera.
no feature***This fine little camera just earned a glowing nod in the June, 2006 issue of Popular Photography, for which it was praised for its relatively fast, relatively fixed maximum aperture of f3.3 (35mm equivalent zoom range is 36-432 mm, with the maximum aperture varying from f2.8 to 3.3) at 420mm.
design***Ergonomically it may resemble a digital SLR only in the sense that its controls are easy to reach and use.
pictures***Like other recent Panasonic Lumix cameras, this one has a superb image stabilization feature for handholding under low light conditions or fast-paced action shots with an equivalent film speed of up to ISO 1600!
battery***In plain English, this is the perfect little digital camera for taking pictures under almost every condition imaginable, with an ample power supply from its Lithium battery.
pictures***The Leica-designed, Panasonic-built zoom lens offers exceptional image quality.
design***I personally like this camera's silver finish, which reminds me a lot of classic 35mm Leica M rangefinder cameras like the Leica M3, M2 and M4.
zoom***But better yet, this superzoom digital camera isn't as expensive as a Leica M rangefinder camera; surely at its current low price, it's the best bang for the buck with regards to features and image quality.
