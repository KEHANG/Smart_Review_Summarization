no feature***All my life, I've used cameras that require film.
no feature***Two weeks ago, my wife and I acquired our first digital, the POWERSHOT S45, and last week gave it an initial workout at Bryce, Zion, and Grand Canyon national parks.
no feature***This review is by no means exhaustive as I've yet to master all of the camera's features; it's a summary of relatively superficial first impressions.
pictures***The bottom line is that this 4 megapixel device takes impressively good pictures of such high detail resolution that my wife, a graphic designer, expects to use its output in PhotoShop for her professional work.
size***It's small enough to be easily held in one hand, and is so light as to be barely  noticeable when carried in a small padded bag hung around the neck.
no feature***(The old 35 mm was a millstone in comparison.)
other features***The silvery finish is smudge resistant, as when handled with fingers made greasy with french fries.
battery***You may wish to purchase an extra rechargeable lithium battery.
battery***After neglecting to re-energize it overnight after taking some ten snaps, the battery pooped out the next day (in the middle of our Bryce exploration) after taking an additional fifty-eight shots.
no feature***Of course, being new to the digital experience, we were using up a lot of power constantly reviewing our photo masterpieces on the LCD screen.
battery***In any case, the power cell recharges surprisingly quickly.
other features***Also, we thought it prudent to purchase the larger 256 MB CompactFlash card (for in-camera image storage) to replace the 32 MB card provided.
screen***Speaking of the screen, it's fairly small at1.5 x 1.12 inches, and its display is very difficult to see in bright sunlight.
screen***And, if you need glasses to read small print, keep them handy to decipher the system's on-screen icons.
zoom***While the 3x optical zoom lens is swell as far as it goes, the inability to attach a polarizer filter can be immensely aggravating under certain conditions.
other features***The shutter button's surface is smooth and entirely flush with the camera body; I was insecure enough to have to constantly check that my finger was on the button.
other features***One of the camera's greatest strong points is its wealth of features.
ease of use***For the digital novice, this versatility is perhaps an initial disadvantage since it'll take effort and time to become knowledgeable and well-practiced in all of them.
ease of use***Indeed, the 181-page user guide is a prodigious read.
ease of use***But, it is, to the extent that I've so far digested it, commendably comprehensive and easy to understand (with a plethora of illustrations).
other features***The provided software and transfer cable made uploading of each day's output to our PC laptop completely effortless.
no feature***(My wife would subsequently transfer the image files to a CD for future manipulation in PhotoShop on her Mac.
no feature***)My wife takes a lot of pictures that leave me rolling my eyes and shaking my head.
no feature***Unfortunately, the digital nature of the POWERSHOT S45 leaves me unarmed with the old argument, "You're wasting film!"
no feature***Isn't technology wonderful?
pictures***After over a month experimenting with most of the function/settings, have to admit I'm pretty impressed on both built/picture quality of the Canon newly improved S45.
detection***Even at auto mode you can hardly produce a bad shot, provided that I'm a die-hard manual SLR fan of NIKO FM2 for nearly twenty yrs.
other features***Rarely need to use photoshop to polish/adjust pics taken by S45, unlike my previous digital camera which I have to spend lots of time to correct digital noise, redeyes..etc.
no feature***When shopping for digital camera, don't get too obsessed with megapixels or spec.
no feature***'number', what's more important are the software/chips which make the camera provide precise light sensing & focus accuracy as well as flexible tweaks when you want your pics to have optimum result at any given changing shooting environment.
no feature***This point is well taken by users of Sharp's 4mp digital camera which uses Canon G2 equivalent lens but produces far inferior pics than Canon's even though Sharp's camera cost 40% less (so is the quality...).
battery***For S45, a large capacity CF card & a spare battery is always a must if you do indoor flash shooting & prefer to store pics at high resolution(which gives you stunning result), costco's website do provide a package deals that include above mentioned extras at reasonable price.
other features***LCD comes with a clear plastic cover that gives you enough protection, or you can buy those LCD protection sheets for PDAs then cut to desired size for less than five bucks.
zoom***Exterior of S45 is a nice brushed metal finish which provides enough protection for its lens.
no feature***No comment on the software since I installed the camera's driver only & use photoshop to polish when needed.
other features***Twain driver is quickly recognized by most 3rd party graphic & photo album softwares when hooked up with PC.
size***Upon comapring Canon's G2,G3,S230 & S45, S45 provides the best combination between size/function/pic quality criteria & one can hardly go wrong with any of them.
pictures***Upon comapring Canon's G2,G3,S230 & S45, S45 provides the best combination between size/function/pic quality criteria & one can hardly go wrong with any of them.
no feature***The adamfblock (from SF) review above was just about perfect.
no feature***Everybody likes this camera.
no feature***But nobody thinks any camera is perfect, a rating should be given relative to peers, meaning in this case 5 stars.
quality***If you research this camera you will find no strong argument that any camera in its class exceeds the S-45 in quality/features.
no feature***The G3 is a better camera, but too big for my purposes.
no feature***I would miss all those spontaneous surprise shots if I ony had a G3, because I would not have it with me.
no feature***And while size of aternative really tiny cameras is nice, everyone agrees that the loss of features/quality in those is rather significant (at this point).
size***The S-45 is small enough to carry around most everywhere, I got the little leather container that can be worn on your belt like a pocket knife, that is nice.
no feature***If you only have one camera, and want to avoid any driving desire to replace it in the next 5 years, this is a good bet.
no feature***The Canon S45 is an excellent digital camera with a few drawbacks.
price***As far as 4MP cameras go, it is a bit pricey but the quality of the camera build and the features on the camera make it well worth the price.
size***While the camera isn't exactly shirt pocketable, it is still fairly easy to carry around with you and not overly bulky.
detection***On the plus side, the S45 has:1) 9 point AutoFocus
other features***2) DIGIC processor which speeds up capture of photos and their quality
zoom***3) 3x Optical Zoom (who cares about the digital zoom)
pictures***4) 4 MP picture quality
ease of use***5) Easy to use interface with quick access to manual settings via FUNC button
ease of use***6) close to centered tripod attachment for easier stitch photo taking
other features***7) A ton of manual settings (exposure settings, aperture settings, shutter settings, white balance, photo effects, and more!) Almost all the settings available on Canon's high end G3 camera!
other features***8) A pretty tough metal body
other features***9) Ability of the camera to take RAW shots for photoediting.
detection***On the minus side:1) Decent to weak flash that is better than the S400 but still weak for low light and night photos at greater than 10 feet away.
battery***2) Decent to below average battery life... 200 shots on a full charge with LCD on in my experience
other features***3) Slide door that protects lens and doubles as power switch worries me in quality a bit.
detection***4) Red eye problems with straight flash use but much less so when the red eye reduction is used.
other features***5) I wish it had a hot shoe or some other way to add an external flash unit.
pictures***The camera takes fantastic shots even when in manual mode although its strengths will be found when you learn the manual settings of the camera.
no feature***I think this is a better buy than the Canon S400 since they are the same price.
size***If you're willing to sacrifice a little size... this Canon won't disappoint!
no feature***After extensive research, I decided on this camera as a replacement for my older 2 megapixel Olympus 2040.
size***I have been very impressed with it so far - it seems very well built (sturdy), is small enough to fit in my coat pocket, and takes great pictures.
zoom***The telescoping lens extends and retracts very quickly making it easy to take a picture on a moment's notice - this was a problem with my old camera - it was too slow.
no feature***When researching the camera, I was trying to find one that took "AA" batteries since they are much cheaper (NiMH).
battery***However, the Canon NB-2L battery isn't too expensive if purchased from a third party retailer (I got a generic one for [$$]).
other features***Also, the included charger is very small and portable with built in retractable AC plug - it's lightweight and easy to throw in a bag and take with you.
detection***The camera records the orientation that each photo is shot with in the EXIF header, and if you use the bundled Canon software to download the photos, it auto-rotates them for you.
no feature***This is very handy.
no feature***Unfortunately, it doesn't work if you use other software such as iPhoto or Image Capture.
ease of use***The mode dial is very handy - it has enough settings on it (ie, automatic, manual, shutter priority, aperture priority, night shot, portrait, movie mode, etc.)
no feature***that you can quickly flip to the one you want.
no feature***My old camera required the use of menu systems to set most of these modes - the dial is much faster.
other features***The camera features a stitch mode which allows you to stitch together multiple pictures to form a panorama.
other features***When in this mode, the camera shows you the last picture you took (offset to the side) allowing you to roughly overlap 1/3 of the next picture with the previous one.
other features***Using the included stitch software, I was able to easily make a Quicktime VR movie - pretty cool.
other features***You can also make panoramas with this mode, and unlike some manufacturers (Olympus), this works with any brand of CF card, it doesn't have to be the manufacturer supplied one.
other features***The only drawback I've found for this camera is the lack of a USB auto-mounter feature ("Mass Storage Device") which many other cameras have.
other features***This feature allows you to just plug in the USB cable to your computer and have the camera auto-mount on your desktop like any other removable disk.
other features***I wish Canon would include this feature since it enables you to completely bypass software for the import process.
no feature***This is something I can live without though - the other features make up for it.
no feature***Overall, a great camera which I would highly recommend!
no feature***When my Nikon CoolPix died after two years, I decided to go back to the brand that I have had all my life, Canons.
no feature***I must say that I am not disappointed.
no feature***The choice was between the S45 and the G3, I decided to go with the S45 bacause of its size and I figured I could do without the ND filter on the G3.
no feature***The S45 is amazing.
detection***Incredible focusing speed and image capture.
no feature***My Nikon would take so long to capture the image that the subject would move, ruining the composition, not so with the S45.
no feature***It is truly one of the best digicams on the market.
pictures***The images are crisp and true to life and the colors are just brilliant.
no feature***What can I say, I am back on the Canon train.
no feature***I bought this camera a few months ago.
no feature***I really like it but I found some drawbacks on this qonderful camera.
no feature***(It is impossible for me to find a perfect camera)1.
zoom***Zoom control is not easy to use.
zoom***Unlike S400, zoom is locked in step.
zoom***The control is ok but not as good as traditional SLR cameras or S400.2.
detection***When you switch to P, A, S, etc mode the 9 points auto focus function is gone.
no feature***This is not a big deal though if you can use the other auto functions.3.
zoom***I wish they change the way len is cover by sliding cover.
zoom***I don't feel very confident that the len is protected by dust.4.
other features***Macro is not working very well.
no feature***I guess it must be the same as most digital camera.
no feature***Ok.
no feature***Most of these complaint (except the first one) I fully expected when I bought.
no feature***Why the heck I bought this camera?1.
pictures***Canon digital camera has the best picture quality.
price***About the same as Nikon but cheaper.
no feature***Far superior than Kodak.2.
price***Compactflash memory is cheaper than other format.
no feature***Unlike other, high capacity memory card is available.3.
other features***More manual control over S400 but not too much as G serie.
pictures***I think 4MP is more than enough unless you want pictures more than 8X11.
no feature***Hope this review helps your purchase decision.
no feature***The Canon S45 is basically a revision of the S40 with some newer software included.
no feature***The S40 is itself a version of the Powershot G3 without the gimmicks like remote control, flash mounting, and a few other tricks.
other features***The sensor and optics are the same for all three cameras, the difference is in the software on the camera, the editing software for the PC that comes with it, and the gimmicks.
no feature***The S45 is a nice camera.
pictures***The user interface is much better than on the S40, and it still has the excellent color quality and image resolution of a 4MP camera.
design***It is ruggedly designed, has high quality optics and CCD, and numerous buttons that are out of the way for normal use.
detection***It has full auto and full manual modes, so it's appropriate for beginners and experienced users.
other features***The downside of the camera is the slow startup time.
other features***The flash is also in a spot where your finger might cover it if you're not careful.
pictures***There is some noise at low light levels, but this is true of all CCD cameras, and the S45 is about average in this respect.
pictures***The images are excellent at high resolution/large file size, but the included 32MB flash card is a joke.
no feature***Canon should know better, and ship all cameras with at least 256MB cards.
other features***The major downside of the package is the photo editing/printing software that comes bundled with the camera.
ease of use***It's user interface is an atrocity, buttons have icons rather than labels, there is no menu tab, etc.
other features***The camera is quickly recognized by USB port, and the downloads are quick.
other features***Just be sure to get Photoshop or another quality editing software package, rather than relying on the [stuff] that comes bundled with this camera.
no feature***I recently purchased this camera after having previously owned a Fuji Finepix 2600.
no feature***After owning the 2600 for just over a year the lens mechanism got stuck and the camera completely broke.
no feature***It had a 1 year warranty which had just expired, and there's no use paying to fix it.
no feature***I figured it was time to upgrade, so I spent hours and hours searching CNET and other review sites for 4MP digital cameras and I finally found this one.
no feature***I would have gone with the Nikon Coolpix 4300, except Canon had their Digic chip which was supposed to allow the camera to go from shot-to-shot faster.
no feature***Also I own an old Canon SLR camera, and I trusted the brand.
no feature***This camera is a very good transition from my SLR, much better than my old Fuji.
pictures***I wanted something with image quality close to that of my film SLR, without the bulkiness or price of a digital SLR.
pictures***So far this camera has done that, producing some wonderful shots.
detection***It has plenty of features ranging from customizable shutter speeds and lens aperture to exposure compensation and 12 scene modes, making it great for shooting in any condition.
detection***One of the great features is the AF lamp, a brief light that goes off before the picture is taken that helps focus the image.
detection***It works great for low light shots.
other features***Another astounding feature is the ability to set ISO speed, just like you would on a film camera.
no feature***My last camera was almost the same price as this one and has none of these features.
no feature***I guess that shows how much prices have come down in the past year.
no feature***There are not many cons about this camera.
size***It's smaller than most cameras with the same amount of megapixels, but it's still not as lightweight as some of the Casio models or Canon's digital Elph.
pictures***The pictures on ISO 200+ have significant noise, even with noise reduction, and the optical zoom could be larger, and the macro is sub-par, but that's really all that is bad about this camera.
battery***Battery life is great, although it uses a proprietary lithium battery.
no feature***Here is a list of pros and cons:
other features***Pros:- Digic image processor.
other features***- Large array of features.
pictures***- Great quality photos.
other features***- Panorama stitch mode.
battery***- Great battery life.
other features***- Movie mode with sound.
pictures***Cons:- ISO 200+ has significant noise.
other features***- Poor macro mode.
battery***- Lithium battery instead of AA.
zoom***- Optical zoom could be larger.
no feature***Overall this is a great camera and many other reviewers agree with me.
price***It's not too expensive but has features of cameras almost twice as expensive.
no feature***If you're a beginner photographer you might want to stick to something simpler, as the features are more than you need you, but if you're looking to move up from an old digital camera I guarantee this is the best deal you're going to find.
no feature***I purchased the canon after a long period of lamenting over the cost and the features of this camera versus a G2, or another brand (Fuji, Olympus).
no feature***After owning this camera for ~6months I am relatively happy with it.
no feature***I picked the S40 over the G2 based on power off to shoot time and abitlity to stuff it in my pocket in a hurry to switch from camera to DV.
no feature***The G2 took ~2 seconds longer to power up than the S40, and it is also quite a bit bigger.
detection***The CCD is the same, and I needed the point-and-shoot feaures also so the S40 was the winner.
pictures***Picture quality is superb, but you have to know how to shoot a good picture to begin with.
other features***The response time to capture an image is great if the AiAE is set to center weight and not evaluative.
detection***This helps to keep the desired target in focus and reduces autofocus times tremendously.
other features***The .avi clips are good quality so its a nice feature, but I wouldn't use it as a video camera, more for action type shots that you don't want to miss...
no feature***I've had my Canon S45 for about three months now, and I am still discovering new features that make it even more endearing.
pictures***The picture quality is excellent under almost any conditions.
pictures***The 4.1 megapixels are more than sufficient, in fact, I often dial down the resolution to save file space.
video***The movie clips with sound are much better than I expected.
design***The sturdy silver case with the clamshell cover is my favorite feature.
size***It fits easily in my pocket, and is easy and quick to open for that first shot.
ease of use***The software was simple to install and use, and the instruction manuals (almost as thick as the camera) were nicely done.
other features***I ordered a 128mb card with the camera, which holds an amazing quantity of photos and film clips - highly recommended.
no feature***There are only a few minor complaints.
other features***The viewfinder is very plain and doesn't display the digital zooming effect, so you are very dependent on the LCD screen.
screen***The screen is nearly impossible to see in direct sunlight, and the data is very tiny.
other features***Also, the low battery indicator doesn't seem to appear until there is only power for one or two more photos.
detection***Red eye can be a problem, although coaching the photographed people to look at the pre-flash srobe, as the directions explained, does work well.
pictures***And some photos containing horizontal lines can have a jagged appearance at some resolutions, but it is usually minimal.
no feature***But I have adjusted to these little problems and don't consider them reason enough to not recommend this little marvel of technology to anyone!
