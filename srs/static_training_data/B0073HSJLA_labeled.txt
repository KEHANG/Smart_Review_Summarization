no feature***This is the second Nikon waterproof camera we've purchased.
no feature***The first was the AW100, and I like both cameras for different reasons.
no feature***I bought the AW100 for me to use while scuba diving in shallow water, and I got the S30 for the kids to use in the pool.
no feature***It's perfect for them.
ease of use***The buttons are large and easy to use, and I like the setup - the shutter button and video record button are both on top, separated by the on/off button, and all the menu, feature and playback buttons are on the back.
design***I think this is a great design for kids.
other features***Many of the "fun" options in the camera are definitely designed to appeal to kids, but I'm looking forward to trying some of them, too, such as the time lapse and fireworks modes.
pictures***In terms of images, the HD videos are very sharp, and the photos are also good, as long as you make sure to set the camera to the highest resolution.
video***In terms of images, the HD videos are very sharp, and the photos are also good, as long as you make sure to set the camera to the highest resolution.
pictures***Note that if you select the option to add an in-camera frame to your images, the camera seems to default to the lowest resolution - 2 MP - so I would avoid this setting if you want good quality photos.
other features***You can always add a digital frame later with photo editing software.
no feature***I think this is a great camera if you just want something to take to the pool or the beach and you don't want to worry about the kids dropping it in the water or on the ground.
ease of use***It's easy to use, takes good photos, and you can't go wrong with a Nikon.
pictures***It's easy to use, takes good photos, and you can't go wrong with a Nikon.
battery***The only things I don't like about this camera are the AA batteries (I wish it used the same rechargeable as my AW100) and the battery/memory card door; I have to use both hands to slide the lock one way and slide the door the other way.
design***You won't have to worry about the kids accidentally opening it, which is a good thing, but I much prefer the design of the AW100.
price***Other than that, however, I think this is a great camera for the price.
no feature***I purchased this camera approx.
no feature***2 weeks ago and wanted my 4 year old son to get some use before rating.
no feature***I feel I can provide a pretty fair summation now.
no feature***So far he likes the camera a lot but there are a couple items that annoy me as the parent supervising said 4 year old.
no feature***So...
other features***First the GripesNumber 1- The constant clock and date reset when changing batteries drives me nuts.
pictures***If you skip it you get an annoying flashing warning!Number 2- Picture quality in lower light is poor to say the least.
pictures***The camera has to be held very still and then it's a gamble.
pictures***When the image does come out it looks like VGA phone cam quality.
other features***The auto-flash works when it wants, most times its out to lunch.
screen***Number 3- The resolution of the screen is marginal so its hard to see if the shot is ok or poor.
zoom***Number 4- As another reviewer wrote, it would be great to disable the digital zoom.
zoom***It blows right through optical and into the digital very easily.
pictures***Number 5- It tends to make very vibrant colors look fake.
no feature***See Hibiscus of the pictures I have attached...
other features***Now the Positive StuffNumber 1- The flash is in the center so the little guy won't cover it with either hand.
battery***Number 2- Battery life is outrageous- I got 532 outdoor shots out of a single pair of rechargeable Sanyo Eneloops and had battery life to spare but it was time to go home.
pictures***Number 3- In outdoor use, in direct sunlight, the pictures are very vibrant.
other features***Number 4- There is virtually no delay when hitting the button for pictures.
no feature***This makes a 4 year old very happy.
no feature***Number 5- We spent 4 hours plus with the camera directly in water and often submerged.
no feature***We were merciless as we're still within the return period.
other features***Number 6- Underwater shots are terrific and fun!My initial impressions when my son used the camera in our home were very bad mostly due to poor, blurry indoor images.
no feature***Had we not given it a thorough tryout at a water park yesterday this review would look very different.
pictures***The great pictures this camera created yesterday really helped me like the camera much more.
no feature***In summary, this camera is good for a 4 year old with little adult assistance.
no feature***This is not, however, a "Family Cam" as people old enough to use a more advanced camera will insist on doing so.
no feature***Update 9/16/12We went swimming this weekend and after a few shots underwater I noticed condensation in the lense and display... Will contact Nikon this week.
no feature***Only the third time in water and less than 5 feet deep.
no feature***Hope to resolve soon.
no feature***Update 9/18/12Called Nikon.
no feature***Connected with a rep very quickly but sound quality and accent made it difficult to communicate.
no feature***Rep said camera should not have been taken in the water and the camera is not waterproof!!!
no feature***WOW!!
no feature***!I stated the body of the camera, packaging and manual said otherwise.
no feature***He said maybe he was wrong.
no feature***Asked for my name and email and is supposed to be sending me a link with warranty info etc.
no feature***Update 9/21/12Reviewed emails sent by tech.
no feature***These aren't even form letter type emails.
no feature***They are just links to the Nikon help website.
no feature***In the email I was directed to an automated form to setup return.
no feature***Guess what?
no feature***The camera I am trying to return for service is not on the list.
no feature***So called tech support again.
no feature***"Estimated hold time is 2 minutes..." Took 13 minutes to connect.
no feature***I mentioned the camera model is not on the service site.
no feature***He informed me just to type up a note, print it and drop in the box.
no feature***He then provided the address and recommended I ship with UPS.
no feature***As I live next to a Fedex facility I asked if I could use FedEx.
no feature***He mentioned he only recommends UPS as they give you a tracking number...hummm...
no feature***Update 10/15/12Received camera back from Nikon.
no feature***Everything was exactly as I sent it.
no feature***I received a $0 invoice for cleaning and testing.
no feature***There were no notes about anything found, just a poor photocopy of a page from the owners manual about the possibility of lens/ display moisture.
no feature***I assume this means moisture in the body is normal?
no feature***The phenomenon described in the paper was similar to what I experienced so I will try to use again and see what happens...
no feature***My daughter was excited to receive this camera from me.
design***There are several kid friendly elements to the camera like the placement of the shutter button, power button, and video button.
design***Also, the flash is centered, so it is much less likely she will cover the flash with her fingers.
screen***She likes the camera and the LCD screen is fine.
other features***I can attest that it is rugged and waterproof since it was both dropped on vacation and used underwater at the pool.
no feature***There a few things I don't like about the camera.
ease of use***The shutter button is difficult for her to press.
zoom***There is no way to disable the digital zoom.
pictures***She likes taking closeup pictures of things, but the S30 doesn't do well unless set in macro mode.
ease of use***However, the macro setting is only available after a few button clicks in the menu instead of a dedicated button.
other features***Also, my daughter likes to use the Decorate option to frame her photos as she takes them, but using decorations fixes the photos at small 2 megapixel shots.
pictures***Low light performance isn't great for focusing or photo quality.
pictures***She still enjoys the camera and picture quality is fine in good light.
no feature***Much better than the typical "toy" child's camera.
other features***Note: Twice the camera has became stuck which prevented me from changing any settings or turning on the flash.
no feature***This was fixed by choosing to Reset All in the camera settings.
no feature***My 5-yo daughter dropped and broke my old Canon PnS that I gave her to use and since she has interest in taking snaps, I looked for a rugged camera that could survive her hands and yet be economical.
price***This camera fit the bill.
price***It is by and far the cheapest rugged water/shock proof point an shoot you can find.
design***It makes cute animal sounds as alerts and the buttons are well placed.
ease of use***The user interface is simple and clean.
ease of use***It's like this was designed expressly for kids.
other features***I have no complaints at all except that you cannot set it to force flash.
other features***It's either auto or off.
other features***The camera does not activate the flash in many circumstances where it should be used.
pictures***This results in blurry, grainy images where they should be flash-lit and fine.
other features***It waits for really dim light before it activate the flash.
other features***This is the only significant flaw in an otherwise well and appropriately designed camera.
no feature***The Nikon S30 is a great deal, don't let the downers fool you.
price***This is the perfect camera for any family or a great first camera for those who want a versatile Nikon without spending big bucks.
other features***The S30 works well in most situations including rain and snow.
other features***It will survive underwater photography and being dropped.
ease of use***With two dedicated buttons for hassle free one-touch photo and video shooting the S30 is ready when you are.
pictures***It features the same HQ LCD viewfinder as more expensive Nikon's, a built-in LED flash, Nikkor glass lens, image stabilization, motion detection, continuous shooting, self-timer, in-camera editing and scene settings, smile detection, voice memo and music slideshow capabilities, and many other cool features.
detection***It features the same HQ LCD viewfinder as more expensive Nikon's, a built-in LED flash, Nikkor glass lens, image stabilization, motion detection, continuous shooting, self-timer, in-camera editing and scene settings, smile detection, voice memo and music slideshow capabilities, and many other cool features.
video***On top of all that, it records HD videos in addition to 10 megapixel stills!
other features***This camera worked great in the water and out.
pictures***The pictures were only grainy when zoomed in all the way, but overall the pictures were good.
no feature***This camera was perfect for snorkeling and boating.
other features***I got great underwater shots.
ease of use***Extremely easy to use as well.
battery***For a 7 day trip I only changed the batteries twice.
other features***It took a beating on some rocks without breaking.
other features***Most important of all it did not leak water into it and break like most of the other cameras available.
no feature***My intended use for this camera:- Photographs of gardens and landscapes, mainly for before-and-after images, and for documenting technical aspects of in-progress landscape installation work.
no feature***(Valves, wiring, carpentry, etc.
price***)Why I bought this model:- Less than $150.- Runs on (2) standard AA batteries, not a proprietary power pack.- Advertised as waterproof to 10 feet.
battery***)Why I bought this model:- Less than $150.- Runs on (2) standard AA batteries, not a proprietary power pack.- Advertised as waterproof to 10 feet.
other features***(Important because I may use it in wet / muddy conditions in the garden.
screen***)My experience so far:Received the camera in May 2012, took a few hundred shots, dropped it from about 3' onto a linoleum surface (really, not that big a drop,) at which point the LCD screen conked out.
other features***Warranty service was free (complete replacement) but took >6 weeks to process.
pictures***Image quality is good (for such a small lens) *when the camera auto-focuses properly*, which is about 75% of the time, even in broad daylight.
pictures***Frequently tends to over-expose shots in bright light.
pictures***Distortion is quite noticeable, esp.
no feature***when attempting portraits of faces from closer than about 6'.
other features***Macro/close-up mode is good to about 2".
other features***Flash can be set to either "Auto" or "OFF," but cannot be manually locked "ON".
other features***Can be annoying in certain low-light situations.
other features***Not sure about waterproof-ness, haven't tested the unit underwater or in heavy rain yet.
no feature***(I may update my review after using the camera in the rain.
price***)Verdict: Price a bit too high for a camera that doesn't reliably auto-focus or auto-expose.
no feature***Still, for simple utility purposes, it's working OK so far.
pictures***Don't expect great-quality images from it.
price***Excellent "bang for your buck"!
no feature***I was a bit apprehensive about purchasing another underwater camera due to a horrible experience with a Canon, which broke on the first day of my trip to Jamaica.
no feature***I ended up buying the Nikon COOLPIX S30 a few days before vacationing in Cancun and couldnt be happier!
no feature***All of the settings, features, etc.
ease of use***are very clear and simple.
pictures***Although geared towards children, this camera takes excellent underwater photos as well as good regular pictures.
other features***The camera was wet for long periods of time and still did not get water damage (unlike my Canon camera).
no feature***I highly recommend this camera for all ages and for underwater use!
pictures***If you are looking to take mostly dry, quality photos, this camera isnt for you.
pictures***I was expecting this would capture some decent picture but it's very disappointing to see this product from Nikon.
pictures***The image quality is less than average, video quality is pretty bad and very jittery.
video***The image quality is less than average, video quality is pretty bad and very jittery.
no feature***If you are looking for a kid friendly camera get the one from vtech (poor photo but cheap) or spend little more and get a better one.
no feature***I am writing this review because I rely on other people's thoughts about products on Amazon.
no feature***This camera seems to be an either "love it or hate it" purchase....about half and half.
no feature***I fall into the LOVE IT category.
no feature***In March this year I purchased a Kodak Sport C123 camera from Amazon.
no feature***It was cheap and was supposed to be waterproof.
no feature***I purchased it to take pictures while on a family cruise.
no feature***As soon as we got in the water, IT took on water.
no feature***Very disappointing.
no feature***As soon as I got home I sent it back to the seller from Amazon.
no feature***Sure it was cheap - but it didn't work either!A month or so later I was walking through Wal-Mart and saw this Nikon Coolpix S30 camera on the clearance table for $35.
no feature***It was brand new in the package; not reconditioned or a return.
no feature***I thought, "Hey, why not give it a try?"
no feature***as I trust Nikon way more than Kodak (although I own many Kodak point and shoot cameras!).
no feature***I am so glad I did!My daughter and I just got off our cruise ship today - and we went to Half Moon Cay island, where I tried it out.
pictures***It took great pics on land and sea.
pictures***It took great pics inside and out.
other features***Someone else posted about the flash not always going off - I agree - it seems to be whimsical, but heck, it's digital - take another shot then.
no feature***I'll post a few pics I took under customer shots.
pictures***Even if it breaks after this it took much better pics than those tossaway cameras, and I'm very happy; although I think I'll have this camera for a few vacations to come!
no feature***:-)
no feature***I got this camera for Christmas and was not able to try it out until June in Maui.
no feature***I took it snorkeling and it worked great.
ease of use***Very easy to switch from pics to video while under water.
video***I took fantastic video of sea turtles four straight days.
video***Also took great video and pics of grandson boogie boarding and zip lining.
pictures***Also took great video and pics of grandson boogie boarding and zip lining.
price***Great price for a nice little camera.
pictures***The actual photos were great quality, impressive actually... but after going to Aruba on honeymoon, we came home and found that the camera's SD/battery door was SEALED shut.
ease of use***Took me 2 hours and one blistered thumb to open it.
ease of use***I luckily got my SD drive out undamaged, closed it thinking that I fixed the issue... and haven't been able to open it since!
no feature***I'm returning it once I figure out how to return items on amazon.
no feature***My husband and I took this on our cruise to use for snorkeling since our DSLR was going nowhere near the water!
pictures***The picture quality (while obviously not comparing to our DSLR) is pretty good and we got some great pictures of the sea turtles and other underwater creatures we saw (images posted on the product page).
no feature***I tried to hold the camera as steady as possible when taking pictures, but obviously that's difficult in the water, and the turtles aren't holding still to pose!
pictures***Even so, we had very few blurry pictures.
battery***I put in brand new Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA batteries before we left, and the battery indicator was still full when we we came home a week later, even after keeping it on for long periods of time while snorkeling and looking at all the photos each night.
other features***Got an Amazon basics 4 GB memory card that lasted all week as well (camera indicated it would hold about 700 pictures).
ease of use***The battery/card cover was hard to get open when we got back.
no feature***It looks like it has some salt built up around the edges, so we'll see how it works the next time we use it.
price***BUT, considering we took 300+ underwater pictures and the disposables would have cost about $10 each + $10 or so to develop and they only take 27 pictures each AND we'd only have printed, not digital, photos from them, it was still a great buy, even if we only get one vacation out of it.
other features***Bottom line: While I wouldn't make it my everyday camera, it worked great for underwater pictures, which is why we bought it, and I'm so glad we got this instead of wasting money on disposables.
other features***A word of caution: if you're using it in waves or taking it in and out of the water, make sure the lens is free of drops, since the screen can be hard to see in the sun.
no feature***I wasn't paying attention and had some otherwise great above-water pictures obstructed by water drops on the outside of the lens.
no feature***My experience was similar to many others.
quality***First dip in 1 foot of water and I think that I got about 6 photos before it stopped working and that was it.
no feature***Nikon replaced the camera but who cares.
no feature***1 star only because I could not give it 0.
other features***I love the flexibility of this super little Coolpix camera !
no feature***I also have a D90 (which I also use, but not as much as I did prior to the Coolpix tool) and lots of lenses from my traditional F2s, and FGs, plus medium format stuff ... not to forget video equipment!!
no feature***!As a Photojournalist in the military, I spent many years lugging equipment around with me ... plus many hours in the darkroom, as well as in "The Field" ... Say no more.
pictures***The Coolpix allows me to take pics and video just about anywhere, including on/in water.
video***The Coolpix allows me to take pics and video just about anywhere, including on/in water.
price***Super clarity & great value for its price!Thank you Nikon!
no feature***Such a blast!
battery***this camera is amazing i like it the ony thing i don't like is that it did not come with a meomery card so i took some photos and know i can't find them and it doesn't come with a charger and the batterys died the other day so i put in rechargeable batterys so i think you shouild buy it
no feature***I purchased this camera to take on a cruise last week.
pictures***The photos were fine before we tried to use it in the water.
other features***Took the camera on a snorkeling trip and afterwards there was water behind the lens.
pictures***The camera never functioned properly after that, photos continued to get progressively worse until finally it stopped working altogether.
other features***The camera's waterproof level indicated 10 feet.
no feature***We never had it more than 3 feet under and it was never dropped.
no feature***We had to buy disposable cameras for the rest of the vacation.
no feature***So disappointed.
no feature***I am returning today.
no feature***We took this camera in July 2012 down all 277 miles of the Colorado River through the Grand Canyon.
video***The videos, pictures and sound were all really good quality.
pictures***The videos, pictures and sound were all really good quality.
video***I used the video feature to film running several rapids and the video came out fantastic.
other features***I even dropped the camera 5-ft hitting a boulder and bouncing into the river.
no feature***The current dragged the camera down river 10-feet on the muddy bottom in 4-ft of water.
no feature***We somehow found it and it worked perfectly for the remainder of the trip as it does still today.
no feature***In the future, I will use multiple smaller memory disks changing them daily in case I were to lose the camera again.
no feature***That way I only lose that days pictures.
battery***My only issue is that the battery life using the video feature was very short.
no feature***I bought one of these despite the bad reviews.
no feature***I should have listened.
battery***There are 2 battery compartment doors, one inner and one outer.
battery***The inner one got progressively worse to close until one day it no longer closed.
no feature***This was 3 months after purchasing it.
no feature***I sent it back to their "repair" facility assuming the warranty would cover this.
no feature***They emailed me an invoice for the cost of a new camera and said they would not fix it for free.
other features***So basically, they did not want to fix a defective camera AND they wanted to make a profit on selling me a new one!!!!
no feature***What a peice of crap and what a TERRIBLE company.
no feature***The camera is going in the trash and I will never purchase anything from such a horrible company again.
no feature***I'm pretty sure their "Repaif Facility" is a just a place where they either send out a new camera at no charge or a bill to send out a new camera.
battery***Batteries lasted about 2 pictures before it died.
battery***Same with any other brand new pair of batteries, this camera just sucks the life out of them.
other features***Flash only works when you aren't swimming.
no feature***This is shameful, Nikon.
video***The video quality is total poppycock.
other features***The picture-edit software on the CD?
no feature***Doesn't even work.
no feature***Returning the camera as soon as I can.
pictures***Picture quality in wate terrible ...... flash is random works when it wants to.
no feature***spend the extra 30 - 50 bucks for a panasonic or fuji ...
no feature***I bought this camera to take with me snorkeling in the Keys.
no feature***Surprise!
other features***As soon as i dipped it into the water, it leaked the water into the camera.
other features***This camera is not waterproof at all.
no feature***I even bought a floating rist band, so it wouldnt sink and go under the 10ft.
no feature***That wasn't even needed.
no feature***I did only one dip and it ruined!
no feature***This deserves zero stars in my opinion.
no feature***I really cannot understand some of the reviews.
no feature***This camera is not meant for kids, especially 5 year olds.
no feature***I have given my kids a few cameras which lasted maybe 1 month and they were 15 and 20 years old and the only reason they failed was because they dropped them, any camera is going to fail after dropping several feet.
other features***I have been using this camera all week in Aruba with some taken in and out of the water and haven't found any problems with water leaking or fogging.
video***I did one video while I was in the pool and it looked pretty good for a $70 dollar camera.
battery***Batteries last a long time and just replaced them after 3 days of partial use or maybe 60 to 70 photos and they were the original standard batteries that came in the box.
battery***The battery compartment gives me no problems with a inside latch that holds the battery in and a safety lock to close the compartment all together.
pictures***Under water, the camera took some great photos of fish on a reef and never noticed the flash going off but all photos were plenty bright even in a partly cloudy day.
other features***From using at night, the flash did not work unless it was really dark, but again, I only bought this camera for the water and beach during the day.
no feature***I use my more expensive $350 camera for other shots especially at night.
no feature***I do think they will have to fix the flash issue because in the menu it only gives you the option auto or off and I do not think the light sensor is very accurate.
other features***When I did use the camera when it was somewhat dark, I just covered the sensor with my finger so the flash would go off.
no feature***From what I had experienced, I highly recommend this camera for snorkeling and day time use and lit areas at night hence the 4 star rating instead of 5.
no feature***You don't buy this camera because it takes good pictures.
no feature***You buy it as a first camera for your kid.
other features***It is more shock proof than most, it is water proof down to 10 feet.
other features***It also won't set you back an arm and a leg so when it finally gives up you will hopefully feel like your kid learned how to handle a camera and can move on to better things.
other features***It takes photos, videos, allows some creative touches that are fun for kids and while the quality isn't always the best it will give your kid a good first experience with cameras.
video***It's been in plenty of water, not too deep though, and it looks beautiful when I take videos in the water.
battery***The only problem is the sand granules got stuck where I try to shut the battery lid so it makes it more difficult to shut it, but it still works.
other features***I loved it, it was great underwater and clear.
pictures***Also took a bunch of pics of different things and it worked great.
no feature***Awesome camera!
pictures***Great underwater pictures, clear and perfect pictures during the day.
other features***Not so good at night and camera auto flashes when it wants (which can be good or bad), otherwise this is an AWESOME camera!
no feature***My kid love's it!
battery***If only it came with rechargeable batteries, I would give it five stars.
battery***If you use the video feature a lot, the AA battery purchases are going to be plentiful.
other features***It's waterproof to 9ft.
other features***That's waterproof in the tub, the sink, the wading pool, and a good part of the beach.
no feature***I bought this camera to take pictures in the rainforest.
no feature***I haven't used it there yet but I have used it around the house and while hiking.
pictures***It takes excellent pictures outside.
pictures***Indoors, the quality can sometimes be sub-par.
pictures***This is usually a problem with point and shoots (getting the lighting right indoors) but this one really requires a lot of light to take a good picture without the flash.
size***The other downside is it is a little bit bulkier than my last waterproof camera, but only slightly so.
no feature***Otherwise, it is an unbelievable deal.
other features***It has almost all the settings that more expensive cameras do.
other features***Unfortunately, there is only one macro setting, but that's not too important to everyone.
ease of use***Settings are changed on the camera using an lcd menu, which is not as easy as the dial that many cameras come with, but after learning how to work the menus I think it is just as easy.
price***I think for the money, it's a great camera for someone who spends a lot of time outside and wants to use the camera for such situations.
pictures***Not a good purchase for someone that wants to take mostly indoor pictures or even for someone who really wants to use it for taking underwater snorkeling pictures.
other features***Considering the low-light issues with this camera and the small depth restriction, it would be better to purchase a more expensive underwater camera if using primarily for underwater picture taking.
size***Excellent little camera.
ease of use***The menues are a bit confusing at first, not very "Nikon" in design.
video***The video does not run for reliable times or repeatable times, it just stops without notice.
size***Overall an excellent little ruggedized snap shooter.
video***Don't buy it for video though.
battery***I would have rated a 4 star, but I need to put batteries in it.
size***It is also somewhat large and sort-of feels cheap.
design***Very plastic(ie).
no feature***This will be used by my daughter.
no feature***After a month of use - I will update this review if I need to downgrade review.
no feature***I decided to purchase this item after ruining a cheap Kodak land camera I used while kayaking and deciding on something waterproof.
no feature***We use the non-waterproof CoolPix models at work and they take decent pictures, so assumed this camera would be comparable quality.
pictures***I have taken it along kayaking 3 times and it takes HORRIBLE pictures, which leaves me sad because some would have been great shots.
pictures***The pictures are fuzzy and grainy at even the highest setting.
video***It also has a video button exposed at the top and occasionally starts taking video while being knocked around in the boat.
design***It looks beautifu, that is why it is tempting to buy it but once we bought itand took pictures for 3 months we have not seen one good picture.
no feature***Our kids looked like frogs in the mad.
pictures***The pictures come out too dark,blurry.
no feature***This camrea is piece of junk.
quality***I purchased the camera and was happy at first and then about two months into using it the side buttons stopped working.
ease of use***Also the part that covers up the memory card and batteries is extremely hard to open.
pictures***It takes good quality photos but not good enough for me to want another coolpix s30.
no feature***Again I would not suggest getting this camera.
no feature***However despite the many problems it was a good first camera and perfect for a snorkeling vacation.
ease of use***It was easy to use and convenient because it runs on AA batteries.
no feature***Purchases this camara for my son to take on a beach vacation.
quality***The first day he took it in the water snorkeling, the camara shut off within 10 minutes.
quality***The lens fogged up and it the sd card was damp.
no feature***He had taken a few pictures on land that came out OK.  We had taken extra precautions in installing the batteries and making sure it was closed properly after reading other reviews of this camara.
ease of use***It is easy to use, but worthless for underwater shots.
no feature***Replaced it with the Pentax and it works great.
no feature***Don't waste your money on this camara if you intend to use it for underwater photos.
pictures***For a Nikon this camera took horrible pictures.
pictures***It is supposed to be a multi-use camera but normal shots came out blurry, dark, and low quality.
no feature***I returned it right away and paid a little more for a better camera with similar capabilities.
no feature***I bought this camera as a last minute purchase before our beach vacation, thinking it would be great for underwater pictures.
quality***Unfortunately, from Day 1 the camera didn't work properly.
other features***I pressed the optical zoom button and the digital display went blurry.
no feature***No amount of other button-pushing or on-off switch pressing fixed the problem.
no feature***However smacking the camera on the side fixed it...temporarily.
other features***The camera would randomly be blurry when turning it on after that and on Day 2 of our vacation we couldn't get the blurriness to go away.
pictures***I also tried to take underwater pics one of the times it was working, horrible result, and went blurry immediately afterward.
quality***This camera looks like its made of cheap plastic and performs cheaply as well...poor quality.
no feature***Don't waste your money on this inferior product.
no feature***Spend a bit more money on a more reliable product like the Olympus Stylus Tough (~$160-190)...this is the camera I went to after the Nikon S30 debacle and very happy with the Olympus so far.
no feature***I bought this camera to do home inspections.

no feature***I bought this camera because it was the only waterproof camera I could find on short notice, before going to the Maldives.
no feature***I was extremely disappointed!
other features***It is far too slow to shoot photos of anything that moves - even in only one foot of water under the full blaze of the bright equatorial sun, it managed to be slow enough that anything except for coral comes out as a blur -- even coral does at times.
pictures***Furthermore, the colors are atrocious.
no feature***The bright and strikingly vivid primary colors I would see with my own eyes would invariably come out as hazy, dull shades of blue in the photographs, even when set on the "underwater" setting.
no feature***Fortunately, ACDSee's automatic color correction did an amazing job fixing this.
no feature***In all, I think I may have salvaged 1 or 2 photos out of every 200.

pictures***The picture quality indoors is really poor and blurry there is a pretty big delay from pushing the button  till the picture takes.
battery***It uses AA batteries which is not ideal but for what I paid I went for it.
ease of use***The buttons and menus are so simple it seems like this camera had to be designed with young kids in mind.
no feature***It will not delete all pictures at once you have to do it one at a time.
ease of use***The pros are the blue color was a big hit and the simple buttons one for record one for pictures was easy for my six year old to navigate.
no feature***My kids where excited that they said waterproof but sad when I suggested we not use them in the water because all the reviews I read said they broke as soon as they entered the water.
other features***If they worked in the water which I am to scared to try, for the price I paid I might up the rating to four stars.
price***Anyway if you buy for kids and get it cheap you'll be mildly happy with this purchase.
no feature***( I think )
